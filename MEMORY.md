## Project State

**Version:** 7.3.3 (2026-07-27) — daily-sync was silently crashing on MEMORY.md's own prose (see Known Issues); this line was stale for a month as a direct result, now corrected by hand.

**Live features (all working):**
- Mesh-based clash detection engine: AABB broad-phase + BVH tri-tri narrow-phase (Möller–Trumbore), optional `_ccWasmIntersect`/`_ccWasmMinDist` WASM accelerators; default clash matrix (skips same-discipline pairs, per-element classification, never skips same-model self-clashes) + N×N matrix UI; rules (discipline filters, clearance, group-by); soft/clearance via spatial-hash vertex distance; hard clashes now report a **real (approximate) penetration depth** (`_estimatePenetrationDepthM` — vertex-inside-mesh ray-parity + true closest-point-on-surface, MTD-style, browser only so far) instead of the old tri-pair SAT chord length; optional escalation to `local-engine.js` for the **same** tri-tri+BVH algorithm at native speed (Numba JIT + multiprocess + scipy KD-tree) — not solid boolean ops, and the Python side doesn't have the new depth estimator yet either (see Known Issues / Active Work)
- BCF 2.1 import/export (viewpoints, markup, snapshots)
- IFC loading via web-ifc WASM (lazy, with geometry + property extraction)
- AI NL command interface (Groq via `/api/nl`, 25+ tool declarations — grew well past the "13" once quoted here, check `TOOLS` in `api/nl.js` for the live count — OpenAI function calling; intentionally basic — clash-solving nudges to your own LLM via the Connector)
- Shared projects (no login, project keys, Neon Postgres backend)
- Data quality checks addon (BIM basics, ILS, NL-SfB classification)
- Smart Bridge: MCP server (`mcp-server.js`) for IDE/AI tool integration
- Revit connector addon (WebSocket live sync, clash push-back)
- Walk mode (FPS navigation with eye height, FOV scroll, unit-aware speed)
- 2D sheet view (Revit-style floor plan: polygon chaining, SVG export, paper size/scale settings)
- Section planes + section box (interactive clipping)
- Issues panel (status, priority, assignee, PDF overlay, viewpoints)
- Training data addon (ring-buffer, JSONL export, sharing)
- PWA (service worker, install prompt, offline caching)
- IDS format export/import for data quality checks
- Shift+click multi-select in navigator tree
- Color-grade FPS counter (grey→red based on framerate)
- Render style hotkeys 1–5 (standard/shaded/rendered/x-ray/wireframe)

**Backend (Vercel serverless + Neon Postgres):**
- `/api/nl` — Groq NL proxy (Groq-only; Gemma dropped). Basic tier; clash-solving nudges to the own-LLM Connector
- `/api/title` — batch AI clash title generation
- `/api/project` — shared issue sync
- `/api/training` — training data ingestion
- `/api/health` — AI + DB status

**Deployment:** `www.clashcontrol.io` on Vercel. No CI/CD for the frontend — merging to `main` triggers a version bump workflow only.

## Architecture Decisions

These are permanent. Do not remove entries — add new ones when significant decisions are made.

| Date | Decision | Reason |
|------|----------|--------|
| founding | Single `index.html` app, no build step | Zero setup for users; open-source transparency; easy to fork/inspect |
| founding | Three.js r128 (pinned, not latest) — *superseded 2026-06-08, see r180 row below* | API stability; newer versions break existing render/material code |
| 2026-06-08 | Three.js bumped r128 → r180, loaded as ESM via import map (#595, v5.19.12) | Unblocks modern-Three features (splat addon dedup, future WebGPU clash path); post-r155 color management/lighting explicitly re-tuned |
| founding | In-browser clash engine: AABB broad-phase + BVH tri-tri narrow-phase (legacy name "OBB engine" is a simplification — orientation only enters via the slimline-axis prune for directional elements). `_ccWasmIntersect`/`_ccWasmMinDist` accelerate when loaded. Optional `local-engine.js` addon escalates to the local Python server for the same tri-tri+BVH algorithm at native speed. *(Corrected 2026-07-13: this row previously claimed the Python engine does "true solid boolean ops" — verified false by reading `ClashControlEngine/src/clashcontrol_engine/intersection.py`; it runs the identical Möller tri-tri + dual-BVH algorithm as the browser, just faster via Numba JIT + multiprocess + scipy KD-tree. Escalating buys speed, not more-correct geometry — see IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md CW-1 for the plan to make it genuinely more exact via real penetration depth + `manifold3d` intersection volume.)* | Tri-tri is the browser sweet spot: tighter than AABB-only (kills false positives on rotated beams/pipes), fast enough for thousands of pairs in JS, and has a clean WASM acceleration path. The Python engine gives the same algorithm the CPU headroom (multi-process, JIT) a browser tab can't. |
| founding | CDN deps pinned with SRI hashes | Reproducible builds; integrity verification |
| founding | Addons pattern (`addons/*.js` IIFE) | Keeps `index.html` lean; optional features don't block initial load |
| founding | Preact/React via CDN UMD (not ESM) | Avoids bundler; works with htm tagged templates inline |
| founding | htm instead of JSX | No transpilation; hand-written parser inlined in the file |
| 2026-04-10 | Stripped ~1960 what-comments from index.html | Comments explained what, not why; moved to INTERNALS.md; reduces file size |
| 2026-04-10 | Camera globals consolidated into `_ccViewport` | Single source of truth for camera/canvas state; avoids global variable sprawl |
| 2026-04-10 | View cube uses `camera.quaternion.copy().invert()` | Camera-position approach causes left/right mirroring; quaternion inversion is correct |
| 2026-04-13 | `processNLCommandWithLLM` wraps `/smart` command | Ensures async handling; keeps NL pipeline consistent |
| 2026-04-15 | 2D sheet uses polygon-face section cut | Correct floor-plan geometry without full mesh boolean ops |
| 2026-07-17 | Six extracted clash-pipeline cores (discipline/assignment/identity/reconciliation/classification/projectCodec) graduated from flagged migrations to the sole, unconditional implementation — inline legacy code, boot-time equivalence checks, and opt-out flags deleted entirely from `index.html`/`safety-migrations.js` | After a soak period at `defaultEnabled:true` with zero drift (550+ unit tests, repeated real-Chromium smoke), the per-boot dual-run validation was pure overhead with no remaining doubt to resolve; a missing module now fails loudly (`TypeError`) rather than silently degrading — deliberate, since there is no fallback left to degrade to |

## Known Issues & Gotchas

Things to be careful about. Do not remove without a good reason — add a note if something is fixed.

- **Three.js r180 API** (was r128 until v5.19.12): use r180 docs. ESM via import map — no UMD `<script>` tag anymore. Post-r155 color management and light-intensity behaviour are deliberately tuned in the renderer setup (e.g. rendered-mode exposure 0.4); don't "correct" them back to library defaults.
- **View cube mirroring**: The nav cube MUST use `cubeGroup.quaternion.copy(camera.quaternion).invert()`. Camera-position approach causes left/right mirror. Don't "fix" this.
- **web-ifc WASM hang**: A 10-second timeout detects WASM init hangs (slow connections). Don't remove this guard.
- **IFC unit scale**: Storey elevations from IFC are often in mm; geometry is in metres. Always apply `geoFactor` when converting. Walk mode and 2D sheet have fixed this.
- **Ghost material is shared**: `MeshBasicMaterial({color:0x334155, opacity:0.08})` is one instance shared across all ghost meshes. Don't dispose it per-mesh.
- **`invalidate()` required**: Any visual change (material swap, visibility, highlight, grid, ghost) needs `invalidate()` or it won't render until the next interaction.
- **Render loop skips GPU work**: `_needsRender` counter > 0 means render. Counter decrements each frame. Call `invalidate(N)` for N frames of rendering.
- **Addon guard required**: Core code calling addon functions must guard with `typeof window._ccFoo === 'function'`. The app must work without addons.
- **Service worker excludes `/api/*`**: Don't add API paths to the SW cache list.
- **NL pre-block**: Conversational messages that look like commands are allowed through to Groq. Don't make the pre-block over-eager.
- **2D annotation coordinates**: Fixed in v4.15.4. Coordinate bug was in annotation placement — if re-implementing annotation rendering, test coordinate transform carefully.
- **IFC spatial hierarchy is NOT a clash-pruning filter**: `IfcProject → IfcSite → IfcBuilding → IfcBuildingStorey → IfcSpace` is logical containment, not proximity. Real geometry spans containment boundaries (vertical ducts cross storeys, foundations sit between site and building, stairs intersect two slabs). Pair pruning must come from the AABB broad-phase / spatial index, not from shared spatial parent. Don't be tempted to "speed up" detection by filtering pairs that share an IfcBuildingStorey only.
- **`scripts/update-memory.py` `replace_section()` must use a callable `re.sub` replacement, not a string one.** A string replacement lets `re.sub` interpret backslashes as group references; this file's own prose contains literal sequences like `\i \c` (documenting XSD regex escapes in the IDS engine notes) which crashed the daily-sync job with "bad escape \i" on every run since it was written — silently, because nothing surfaced the failure. This is why the Project State version line went stale for a month (fixed 2026-07-08). If you see the version line drift again, check the Actions run for this workflow first.
- **Coplanar triangle pairs are deliberately NOT reported as clashes**, in both the browser JS engine (`index.html`, `_triTriTest`) and the Python engine (`intersection.py`, `tri_tri_intersect`). Flush surface contact (a wall base sitting in a slab's top-face plane) is universal in real models — treating it as a hard clash would flood every project with false positives. This is a policy choice, not a missing feature; the explicit near-zero-`d` early-out also avoids a 0/0 NaN in the interval math. Don't "fix" this by making coplanar overlap report a hit.
- **The browser engine now computes a real (approximate) penetration depth for hard clashes**
  (`_estimatePenetrationDepthM`, 2026-07-13, CW-1a) — vertex-inside-mesh (3-axis ray-parity, majority vote)
  + true closest-point-on-surface (Ericson's algorithm), maxed over both sides, MTD-style. Falls back to
  the old tri-pair SAT-chord estimate, then the AABB-overlap estimate, when it can't tell (open/
  non-manifold mesh, or a graze where no vertex of either side is actually inside the other — e.g. a thin
  post clean through a slab; a real documented limitation, not a bug). It's still an *approximation*
  (vertex sampling, not a true solid intersection) — good enough to build the "hard clash, penetration ≥
  10mm" default floor on top of, not good enough to call "exact."
  **The Python local engine does NOT have this yet** — its `penetration_est` is still the old
  AABB-overlap *upper bound* (`intersection.py`, `meshes_intersect_prepared`). Escalating to the local
  engine today for "more accurate depth" would currently give you a WORSE number than the browser already
  computes for free — port the same technique there next (CW-1a Python half), then layer the `manifold3d`
  exact-volume tier on top (CW-1b) — see `IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` CW-1 / Wave 1.5. Don't build a triage/
  severity feature on top of `overlapVolM3`/`penetration_est` as if they were trustworthy depth numbers —
  only the browser's `distance` field is real now, and only for hard clashes.
- **The Python local engine is NOT "exact" in the sense of solid boolean ops** — it runs the identical
  Möller tri-tri + BVH algorithm as the browser (`intersection.py`/`sweep.py`), just faster (Numba JIT,
  multiprocess, scipy KD-tree). Escalating to it today buys speed, not more-correct geometry. See the
  corrected Architecture Decisions row above and `IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` CW-1.
- **IFC worker static-file extraction — research finding (2026-07-17), not yet attempted.** The
  `.toString()`-assembled worker (`_getIFCWorkerUrl`) isn't accidental complexity — it's the specific
  workaround for "no build step + Worker/main-thread code must never drift" in a single-file app. The
  worker Blob concatenates `.toString()` of ~11 functions (`_prefetchWebIfcWasm`, `safeStr`,
  `_extractAxis`, `extractProperties`, `extractStoreys`, `extractSpatialHierarchy`,
  `resolveMaterialName`, `buildMaterialMap`, `buildPropertyMap`, `buildRelationsMap`) plus 3
  JSON-serialized constants (`IFC`, `IFC_TYPE_NAMES`, `_SPATIAL_CONTAINERS`), then wraps
  `_ifcWorkerMain` (the postMessage protocol handler) around them. The main-thread fallback
  (`loadIFC`, a separate function) calls the SAME function objects directly (same scope, no
  stringification needed) — the `.toString()` trick is what guarantees the worker's copy can never
  hand-drift from the fallback's copy, since it's literally serializing the same source.
  **This means extraction is exactly the pattern already proven for the six clash-pipeline cores**
  (`clash-discipline-core.js` etc., see the graduation entry above): move the shared functions to a
  plain static file loaded via `<script defer>` for the main thread AND `importScripts()` inside the
  worker (classic, non-module workers — which this codebase already uses — support this natively, no
  bundler needed). `_ifcWorkerMain` itself (the small orchestration/protocol part) could stay inline
  or extract too. **Caveat that raises the stakes:** these functions are NOT worker-exclusive utilities
  — `safeStr` alone has 23 call sites elsewhere in `index.html`, and the others have 2-6 each — so this
  is a real cross-cutting extraction, not an isolated one. Repo history offers little extra signal here
  (shallow clone, ~173 commits visible, real history goes back much further); the reasoning above comes
  from reading the actual current code, not archived discussion. Phase 7's protocol versioning +
  differential fingerprint harness (`tests/browser/ifc-worker-fallback-differential.mjs`) is the
  correct, already-built prerequisite — expand its coverage (multi-storey, quantities, unit conversion,
  georeferencing, malformed records, cancellation) before attempting the actual extraction, not instead
  of it. Do not attempt this without that expanded coverage — `CLAUDE.md` calls the IFC loader out
  explicitly as complex-but-working, not to be touched without good reason.
- **CORRECTED 2026-07-17: the original "174s/2.56GB for 145,670 elements" large-model number
  (below) was measuring a fixture-generator bug, not real app performance — do not cite the old
  figure.** `tests/fixtures/generate-synthetic-ifc.js` passed a bare `IfcCartesianPoint` as
  `IfcRectangleProfileDef`'s `Position` instead of an `IfcAxis2Placement2D` (a real IFC schema
  violation — the hand-written `smoke-clash.ifc` fixture did this correctly and was never
  compared against). web-ifc's `GetAxis2DPlacement()` logged `unexpected 2D placement type 6`
  and fell back to a slow per-element recovery path for **every single element** — at 10,000
  elements this alone made loads take minutes instead of ~4s. Fixed the generator (adds the
  missing `IfcAxis2Placement2D` + 2D `IfcCartesianPoint`) and regenerated every fixture derived
  from it, including the committed `tests/fixtures/multi-storey-smoke.ifc` (too small — 9
  elements — for the bug's cost to have been visible there, but still invalid IFC). Verified:
  605/605 → 606/606 unit tests (net +1 from unrelated work same day), full smoke green with the
  regenerated fixture, zero console errors on load (previously: thousands of
  `GetAxis2DPlacement` error lines per load, silently ignored).
- **50MB/145k-element IFC load — corrected measurement, external-review-driven follow-up
  (2026-07-17).** With the fixture bug above fixed, re-measured across scales using the same
  real-Chromium-UI-driven approach as before, this time reading the load pipeline's own
  built-in per-phase profiler (`stats.phases`/`streamSub`/`sceneSub` on the loaded model — already
  built, logged via `console.table` on every real load, just not previously read
  programmatically for this kind of measurement). Clean results: **10,000 elements loads in
  ~4.3s.** Scaling from there is markedly **super-linear, not linear** — 25,000 elements measured
  between 12.6s and 41.6s across repeated runs in this sandbox (high run-to-run variance, likely
  shared-environment resource contention; the sub-phase *proportions* were consistent across runs
  even though absolute numbers weren't) — a 2.5× element-count increase should cost ~2.5× more
  time under linear scaling, not 3–10×. **Root cause, isolated via new instrumentation added this
  session (`sceneSub.transferGap`, pure additive `performance.now()` deltas around the existing
  reconstruction/instancing/batching calls, no logic changes):** the dominant cost inside the
  main-thread "Scene build" phase is neither WASM parsing, property extraction, geometry
  building, nor instancing/batching (all comparatively small) — it's the **worker→main thread
  message transfer itself**. At 25k elements, `transferGap` (structured-clone deserialization of
  the `rawEls` array — one JS object per element carrying `geos`/`props` — arriving via
  `postMessage`) accounted for ~4.9s of ~6.7s spent in Scene build (~73%). The large binary
  geometry buffers are already sent as zero-copy `Transferable`s; `rawEls` is not, and structured
  cloning many small JS objects is a known worse-than-linear cost in JS engines as object count
  grows — consistent with what was measured. At the original 145,670-element scale, load still
  exceeded 240s even with the fixture bug fixed, confirming this is a real, unresolved scaling
  problem at the high end, just a different and now-understood one than originally suspected.
  **Not attempted this session:** redesigning the worker→main transfer to encode `rawEls` into
  transferable typed-array buffers instead of a plain object array (the same technique already
  used for geometry data) is the obvious next step and should meaningfully cut large-model load
  time, but it's a real change to the IFC worker protocol — exactly the kind of "worker-transfer
  experiment" the loader's own risk profile (`CLAUDE.md`: complex-but-working, not to be touched
  without good reason; `REDUCER_DECOMPOSITION_PLAN.md`'s loader/worker lifecycle area: risk
  "high", sequenced last) says needs its own careful pass with the differential-coverage safety
  net in place first, not a same-session follow-on to a profiling pass. Re-run via
  `tests/fixtures/generate-synthetic-ifc.js` (now fixed) at multiple `wallsPerStorey` values for
  future comparison; read `stats.phases`/`stats.sceneSub` off the loaded model directly rather
  than parsing the console.table output.
- **Local-engine `distance` mm/metres double-scaling — FIXED 2026-07-21.** An external review
  flagged, and this session confirmed against the Engine repo's `main` branch source, that
  `_clashFromEngineResult` (`addons/local-engine.js`) treated the engine's `distance` field as
  metres and multiplied by 1000 — but the engine already returns millimetres
  (`-round(depth*1000)`/`round(dist_m*1000)`), so a real 10 mm penetration was reported as
  10,000 mm. Fixed by removing the redundant `*1000`; `maxGap`/`minGap` (the input side) were
  double-checked and are NOT affected — both sides already agree those are mm-on-the-wire. Also
  added a capability gate (`window._ccLocalEngineCanHandle`) and client-side re-filtering
  (`_applyClientSideRuleFilters`) for the rule fields the Engine repo still doesn't apply
  server-side (re-verified 2026-07-21: `excludeTypes`/`excludeTypePairs`/`toleranceByTypePair`/
  `duplicates`/`excludeSelf`/`minOverlapVolM3` are sent but ignored by `engine.py` on `main` —
  the Wave 0 "Companion change required in ClashControlEngine" from `IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` was
  never picked up in that repo). See `IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` Wave 0 item 10 and
  `tests/local-engine-units.test.js`. The Engine repo's `/status` still has no capability/
  protocol-version field to negotiate against, so the gate is a hand-maintained snapshot, not a
  live contract — keep it in sync by hand if the Engine repo's rule-handling changes.
- **Candidate-pair memory explosion on the Wasm sweep path — FIXED 2026-07-21.** `_sweepAndPruneWasm`
  (`index.html`) used to expand the Wasm-returned flat index array into a fully-materialized
  `{eA,mA,eB,mB,sameModel}` object per candidate pair immediately after the broad phase — the
  `_CANDIDATE_EST_BYTES=96`-per-pair, ~96 MB @ 1M candidates the large-candidate toast warns about.
  Now returns a compact view (`_makeCompactCandidates`) over `items` (one entry per *element*, not
  per pair) + the flat array; `{eA,mA,eB,mB,sameModel}` objects are built lazily, one at a time,
  only for whichever candidate a consumer is actually reading right now, through a single access
  point (`_candidateAt`) — so at most O(chunk size, currently 80) of them are ever alive together
  instead of O(candidate count). The `_sweepAndPrune` JS fallback (the oracle path) is deliberately
  **unchanged** — still a plain Array of eager pair objects, exactly as the large-model plan's
  Phase 2 asked ("keep the current object-array JS fallback as the oracle initially").
  `_candidateAt` dispatches on `Array.isArray()` so callers don't need to know which shape
  `candidates` is in. New test: `tests/candidate-view.test.js`. **Not independently verified in a
  real browser this session** — this dev sandbox's proxy blocks the CDNs the app needs (same
  limitation noted elsewhere in this file), so the actual WASM-vs-JS clash-identity differential
  (`tests/browser/wasm-sweep-differential.mjs`, promoted into CI this same session) has not
  actually been run against this change yet; it will run on the next real CI push/PR, which is
  the first real verification this specific fix gets.
- **Clash runs/exports now stamp model scope/completeness — DONE 2026-07-21.** The browser-first
  large-model plan's Phase 3 ask ("bounded storey scopes, not progressive loading") turned out to
  already be substantially built and well-tested (atomic `REPLACE_MODEL`/`ADD_MODEL`, the
  `StoreyScopeModal`/`ccUiStoreyChooser` picker, `stats.loadedScope`/`scopedOutCount` stamped per
  model at load time) — confirmed by re-reading the actual code this session rather than trusting
  the external review's assumption that this needed building from scratch. The one genuine,
  narrowly-scoped gap: nothing downstream recorded WHICH models a given clash run or BCF export
  actually covered when a storey scope narrowed the load, so a run against a partially-loaded
  federation could silently read as "the whole building has no clashes." Added
  `_ccSummarizeModelScope(models)` (`index.html`, right before `exportBCF`) and wired it into both
  `detectionSettings` capture sites (`state.detectionSettings.scope`) and the BCF export's
  `README.txt` (a plain-language note naming which storeys were loaded per model, when incomplete).
  New test: `tests/model-scope-stamping.test.js`. Also had to fix `tests/bcf-export.test.js`'s
  narrowest `exportBCF` extraction (it started exactly at `function exportBCF(...)`, missing the
  new helper declared just above it — the file's other two `exportBCF` sandboxes already started
  from `_lookupElBox` instead and were unaffected; the narrow one now does too).
  **Deliberately NOT done, left for the maintainer to decide** (both are product/UX calls, not
  bugs): (1) `ccUiStoreyChooser` is flag-gated off by default in production — flipping that default
  changes every user's first-load experience and needs a first-load-UX decision, not a code fix;
  (2) discipline/search-set-scoped *loading* (as opposed to today's post-load filtering) doesn't
  exist — extending the same atomic pattern to it would be a genuinely new feature, not a gap fix.
- **BCF orthographic-camera export + a real crash bug — FIXED 2026-07-21.** Investigating the
  large-model plan's Phase 4 BCF-fidelity ask ("add orthographic camera export/import") surfaced
  something more urgent than a missing feature: `_captureViewpoint` (index.html) read
  `S.camera.fov.toFixed(2)` **unconditionally**, but `S.camera` becomes a genuine
  `THREE.OrthographicCamera` (no `.fov` at all) whenever the app's own orthographic-view toggle
  (`_ccToggleOrtho`) is active — so saving a viewpoint while in ortho mode threw a `TypeError`.
  Separately, `exportBCF` always emitted `<PerspectiveCamera>`, even for a genuinely orthographic
  view, losing that fact entirely. Fixed: `_captureViewpoint` now branches on
  `S.camera.isOrthographicCamera`, capturing `isOrtho`/`viewToWorldScale` (BCF-XML's
  `ViewToWorldScale` — "view's visible vertical size in meters", verified against
  buildingSMART/BCF-XML `release_3_0`'s `visinfo.xsd`) instead of `fov` for ortho viewpoints;
  `_restoreViewpoint` only touches `.fov`/scale when the live camera's type already matches the
  viewpoint's (switching camera type mid-restore would need the same camera-rebuild-and-rewire
  `_ccToggleOrtho` does — out of scope for a restore call, and position/orientation still restore
  correctly regardless); `exportBCF` emits `<OrthogonalCamera>`/`<ViewToWorldScale>` instead of
  `<PerspectiveCamera>`/`<FieldOfView>` when the viewpoint says `isOrtho`. **Camera import doesn't
  exist at all yet** — the BCF importer (`importBCF`) only parses `<Component IfcGuid>` for element
  identity, never camera data, for either camera type — so "add orthographic import" isn't
  applicable without building perspective camera import first (a separate, bigger feature, not
  attempted here). New tests: `tests/bcf-ortho-camera.test.js`,
  `tests/viewpoint-ortho-crash.test.js`.
  **Deliberately NOT attempted this session** (each is a separately-scoped feature, not a small
  gap): IFC-loader structured warnings for skipped/malformed elements (the loader is explicitly
  flagged in CLAUDE.md as "complex but working — not to be touched without good reason," and no
  existing warning-collection mechanism was found to extend); promoting `ids-conformance.yml` off
  `continue-on-error` (needs real historical pass-rate data from actual workflow runs to set the
  `wrong=0`/baselined-incompletes exit gate correctly — guessing this from source reading alone
  risks gating on a threshold nobody's verified the corpus actually clears); BCF clipping-plane
  export, comment threads, and cross-tool round-trip validation against Solibri/BIMcollab (the
  first two are real, separately-scoped features; the third needs external tools this environment
  doesn't have).
- **Phase 6 (reducer decomposition, next slice) — investigated, deliberately NOT attempted
  2026-07-21.** `REDUCER_DECOMPOSITION_PLAN.md` already names the next slice precisely: Area 2,
  cache invalidation (`_clearElCaches` + `_bvhLRURemoveModel`/`_pairCacheClearForModel`), explicitly
  rated "Risk: low — pure function, no control-flow entanglement, already isolated." That part is
  genuinely low-risk. But the plan's own **Standing rules** require "real-browser verification
  after every slice, not just unit tests" — citing slice 1's own history, where unit tests alone
  would have missed a real runtime timing bug that only a real-browser dispatch-and-read check
  caught. This dev sandbox's proxy blocks the CDNs (React/Three/web-ifc) the app needs to boot at
  all in headless Chromium (same limitation `ids-conformance.yml`'s own comment and other entries
  in this file already document), so that required verification step is not something this session
  can do. Extracting the slice without it would mean shipping the one thing the plan's rules
  explicitly warn against — a refactor whose unit tests pass but whose real-browser behavior was
  never actually checked. Deferred rather than done partially; the next session with real browser
  access should be able to execute Area 2 directly using the plan's own instructions above, unit
  tests plus the required real-browser check.

real starter `locales/ja.json` (needs native-speaker review — flagged as such in its `contributor`
field).~~ (2026-07-23) `regulations/manifest.json` deliberately ships EMPTY — thresholds are
safety-relevant (door widths, ramp slopes) and a fabricated/unverified regional preset is worse
than none; template requires a `source` citation + defaults `verified:false`.
~~Settings → General: Language + Regional building code dropdowns, manifest-driven (fetch manifest

~~`scripts/validate-locale.js`/`validate-regulation.js` — strict JSON shape, 200KB cap, content scan
rejecting `<script`/`javascript:`/`on*=`/raw HTML in strings; regulation packs additionally require
a `source` citation + boolean `verified`, flag unrecognized threshold keys as likely typos. Rides
the existing `npm test` step in `ci.yml` (no workflow changes) via
`tests/locale-regulation-pack-validation.test.js`, which also re-validates every real pack +
manifest entry on every run.~~ (2026-07-23)

Settings — not auto-created like the template's default labels), never the raw submission. Runs
`scripts/apply-contributed-pack.js` (validates, then writes pack+manifest entry; refuses to touch
an id that already exists so automation can only create NEW packs, never silently overwrite a
reviewed one) and opens a draft PR crediting the contributor. Token scoped to

PR #708 (draft) tracks all of the above, 801 tests passing. `pull_request: synchronize` events kept
NOT firing for this PR across the whole session (ci.yml never ran on several consecutive pushes in
a row — worse than the "occasional" flakiness the workflow's own comments describe); no
`workflow_dispatch` API access to fix it directly, so repeated empty-commit pushes were used to
nudge it each time it stalled — worked, but noisy (several `chore: retrigger CI` commits in the
branch history). **If this keeps recurring on future sessions, worth a maintainer looking at
whether the GitHub App installation needs a permissions/webhook fix** — this is an infra flake, not
a code issue, but happened often enough this session to flag explicitly.
Long-tail retrofit of `index.html`'s hardcoded UI strings to `_cc_t()`, panel by panel, each its own
commit: ~~toolbar (Views/Present/Open/Save Project/Import/Export BCF/theme+Settings buttons) +
LeftPanel's shared TITLES map (Models/Conflicts/Issues/Navigator/Data Quality/Accessibility/Tools/
Integrations/Standards) + Settings modal title.~~ ~~IssuePanel in full: sub-tab bar, all filter
controls (search, Status, Discipline, Floor, Distance, IFC Type, Storey, Material, Element ID,
Priority, Category, Assignee, Element Type), empty states, shown-count footer, New Issue/From clash
buttons, Grouped/All view-mode + Group/Sort dropdowns (both clash and issue variants).~~ ~~Data
Quality panel: model selector, run/re-check states, pass/issue badge, delta summary, empty state,
severity legend, section headers.~~ ~~Accessibility panel: model selector, run states, Fail/Pass
legend, summary line, Add to Conflicts, Isolate failing, both disclaimer paragraphs.~~ ~~New Issue
modal: all titles, From Clash/Linked Element context, every form label/placeholder/dropdown option,
Cancel/Create buttons.~~ (all 2026-07-23) `locales/ja.json` kept in sync with every newly-wired key
each slice — updating tests/dq-reconciliation-wiring.test.js's literal-adjacency assertions once,
where `_cc_t()`-wrapping changed the exact source shape a wiring test checked against.

**Split into its own PR partway through**, per explicit direction: PR #708 now covers just the
foundational scaffold (tasks above through the New Issue modal commit); further retrofit work moved
to a NEW branch `claude/i18n-string-retrofit` / **PR #709**, based on `claude/japanese-localization-
request-eleplc` (stacked — retarget to `main` once #708 merges, since this code calls `_cc_t()`
which only exists once #708 lands). PR #709 so far: ~~Settings → Measurement tab in full (units,
precision, magnifier, calibrate).~~ ~~Settings → Walk mode tab in full (eye height, sensitivity,
invert Y, collision, head-bob, footsteps).~~ ~~Settings → Privacy tab in full (anon data sharing,
annotation buttons, recorded-data count summary with separate singular/plural keys — `_cc_t` has no
plural rules — send/delete buttons, browser-storage usage + per-project rows, geometry cache).~~
(all 2026-07-23)  **[STALE?]**
**#709 showing zero CI runs is NOT the same synchronize-event flake as #708** — root-caused it:
`ci.yml`'s trigger is `pull_request: branches: [main]`, i.e. it only fires for PRs whose BASE is
`main`. #709's base is deliberately the feature branch (stacked on #708), so `ci.yml` correctly
never runs here — no empty-commit nudge fixes this, that only ever worked for #708 (base=main).
This is an expected consequence of the stacked-PR structure, not an infra problem — resolves itself
once #709 is retargeted to `main` after #708 merges. (The #708 `synchronize`-not-firing flake
earlier in this doc is real and separate — that one genuinely is a maintainer-follow-up item.)

~~`ViewCube` inspected — its FRONT/BACK/RIGHT/LEFT/TOP/BOTTOM face labels are baked into fixed-size
canvas textures via `ctx.fillText`, not React strings; left untranslated on purpose (translated
words would risk overflow/clipping at the fixed 128×128 texture size, and these read as a CAD-

NOT touch the surrounding property/pset NAME arrays (`'Base Constraint'`, `'IsExternal'`,

~~`NLCommandPanel`'s conversational reply text: the clash-setup dialogue engine (`_clashConverse`/
`_askNext` — clarifying questions for hard/near-miss type, gap distance, same-model-vs-cross-model,
the confirm summary with its type/self/extra clause builders, cancel/stopped replies), the AI-status
backend label ("AI loaded"/"Coordinator"), the 4 correction-feedback buttons (Wrong models/gap/
action, Gibberish), and the Copy message/Copied tooltip. Deliberately left untouched: the regex
patterns themselves (`tl.match(...)`, `/\b(?:...)\b/i.test(tl)`) that parse the user's raw English
input — translating those would require a locale-aware grammar, not a string swap, and is a
fundamentally different (and much larger) undertaking than the rest of this retrofit; and the
suggestion chips (`'Load an IFC file'`, `'Run clash detection'`, etc.) since clicking one calls
`send(sug)`, feeding the literal English text straight into that same English-only parser —
translating the chip label without also translating the parser would silently break the click.~~

**Remaining (long tail, can proceed independently in future sessions):** whatever remains unnamed
across the rest of the ~38.7k-line file — every component from the original explicitly-tracked
retrofit-progress list has now been addressed at least once this session. Partial coverage stays safe
by design (`_cc_t` falls back to the English string for any untranslated key, so the app never
breaks); a future session can keep sweeping for stragglers without a fixed checklist to work from.

~~Attribute sweep (2026-07-27): grepped the whole file for un-translated `title="..."`/
`aria-label="..."`/`placeholder="..."` literals as a systematic way to catch stragglers the
component-by-component pass missed. Found and fixed ~60: 3D viewport overlays (Compare Models
slider, markup toolbar incl. Line/Arrow/Rectangle/Text label/Freehand tool names, perf stats panel,
detection-profile panel, exit-3D-section, measurement/viewpoint delete + Save Viewpoint), project
list rename/delete/confirm, the geoplace panel (IfcMapConversion tooltip, map nudge buttons, CRS
step selectors, OSM Buildings via Cesium ion, height-step controls) and its point-cloud/splat/tiles
alignment row (remove/remove-alignment/remove-proximity-colouring), the PWA install banner, the
splat reference-layers panel, clash-results clear-all/triage-focus controls (incl. its confirm() and
toast strings), RunDetectionModal's scope selector ("What do you want to check?", All↔All/By
discipline/By model, Side A/B — this one had been missed by the earlier component pass despite
RunDetectionModal being marked done), DataQualityPanel's Highlight-in-3D/Create-issue/Print
report/Export CSV/Create-all-issues row, ClashRulesPanel's Assignment Rules sub-panel (discipline/
storey/assignee/priority dropdowns, Add assignment rule) and Visibility & coverage checks header,
Settings modal close/tablist aria-labels, NavigatorPanel row title, floating-panel open/close
titles, the Workspace tablist and Viewer toolbar aria-labels, the command-palette launcher
aria-label, the mobile theme toggle, Assign-to/shared-project-join-key placeholders, and
NLCommandPanel's Good/Wrong-response + Reply-to-message tooltips. Two literal-text test anchors
broke and were fixed in the same pattern as before:
`tests/data-quality-report-wiring.test.js` (Print report / Export CSV button labels) and
`tests/assignment-rules-wiring.test.js` (the "+ Add assignment rule" panel-boundary marker).
Deliberately left alone: the static SEO `<nav aria-label="ClashControl pages">` (outside the React
app — pre-boot HTML for crawlers/no-JS, not reachable by `_cc_t`) and the `placeholder="IfcWall"`
takeoff-panel example (a technical IFC class-name example, not display prose). After this sweep, a
repo-wide grep for capitalized `title=`/`aria-label=`/`placeholder=` string literals returns
essentially nothing outside those two deliberate exceptions — the retrofit's low-hanging fruit is
exhausted; anything left is either template-literal text inside `html\`...\`` markup (not caught by
this attribute-only grep) or genuinely obscure.~~ (2026-07-27)

**Park inactive models — memory relief (2026-07-22, branch `claude/clashcontrol-v7-release-plan-jp5njw`)** —  **[STALE?]**
diagnosed the "viewer stalls a few seconds" + "5.2 GB heap > 4.09 GB limit" reports as the SAME
root cause: GC pauses from being over the heap limit. Dominant reducible sink = the permanently
retained off-scene `element.meshes[]` proxy set (report: 73,402 proxies / 35M verts, "kept for
clash/highlight", never freed while loaded, un-deduped). New feature: **Park/Restore a model** —
PARK_MODEL/UNPARK_MODEL reducer + `parkedModels[]` state; `window._ccParkModel`/
`_ccRestoreParkedModel`/`_ccIsModelParked`/`_ccEnsureModelActive`. Parking drops the model from
`s.models` (existing scene-sync effect disposes its group + geometry, `_clearElCaches` frees BVH)
but KEEPS the geoCache + source file, so restore rebuilds via the fast geoCache path
(`idbGetGeoCache`→`_geoDeserialize`) with the SAME id (clash/issue refs stay valid). Guarded:
refuses to park a non-restorable model (revit-direct/live or no cache+file). Sidebar Park button
(hidden for revit-direct) + a "Parked (memory freed)" section with Restore. Tests:
`tests/park-model-wiring.test.js` (10). Full suite 723 green; index.html re-parses clean.
**NEEDS IN-BROWSER VALIDATION with real multi-model project** (can't run browser here).
Manual park/restore merged as PR #702. **Automatic layer added (2026-07-22):** `_ccAutoParkPass`  **[STALE?]**
runs from the heap poller (now 8s) — under heap pressure (>72% of jsHeapSizeLimit) it auto-parks
HIDDEN, restorable, non-live models largest-first, one per tick, never a visible model, never
mid-detection; gated by the persisted `autoParkInactive` pref (default ON, `SET_AUTOPARK` +
sidebar toggle). "Smart reload": `_highlightById` auto-restores a parked model before highlighting
(clash locate passes modelId). Tests now 17 in `park-model-wiring.test.js`; full suite 730 green.
**Remaining follow-ups: wire `_ccEnsureModelActive` into detection scope; persist parked state
across reload; per-model last-active timestamps for smarter cold-first ordering.**

→ emergency-re-enabled+re-reverted v5.19.27/.28 → removed v5.19.55 2026-06-09, replaced by the  **[STALE?]**
current Instanced/BatchedMesh proxy-preserving approach, permanently CI-gated at
`tests/browser/smoke.mjs:310-370` citing revert commit `366c7cc`; Free-RAM added-then-reverted same
day 2026-06-06 — this session's Park feature is the properly-scoped redo of that same idea;  **[STALE?]**
`_instKey` took 5+ hotfixes on 2026-06-08 before landing on `geometryExpressID` as the canonical  **[STALE?]**
key instead of a position hash). Confirmed independently: `element.meshes[]` has ~40 call sites;
`loadIFCWorker` genuinely doesn't terminate its worker on the geometry `'result'` message while the
main thread builds Three.js objects (`:4806-4925`); `_getBVH` builds per-element from world-space
tris even for shared instanced geometry (confirms `IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` Wave 6 item 3 is real,
unclaimed work); issue #572 (closed 2026-06-06) already flagged `element.meshes[]` retention as a  **[STALE?]**
deferred "D2 follow-up" five weeks ago. Task list added as P6.1-P6.5 (byte-accurate residency
ledger → GeometryHandle/GeometryStore retiring element.meshes[] → memory-safe loading mode →
bounded detection memory (graduates Wave 6 items 3+5) → property paging, deferred pending
telemetry), each tied to which historical guardrail it must not repeat. **Not implemented — this
was a planning-only pass; P6.1 is the recommended starting point (build the ledger before touching
any element.meshes[] consumer, since P6.2's payoff becomes measurable only once it exists).**
**Enriched same day** with a deep background history-mining pass (unshallowed the clone, real
commit hashes verified individually via the GitHub API, not just CHANGELOG version numbers):
chunk-merge's mechanism precisely ("~49 setters never became chunk-aware" per retrospective
`c4f9702`); Free RAM's own revert commit (`6a9882b`) already named "chunks-as-source-of-truth...
query by expressId -> range slice" as the correct fix five weeks before this plan — P6.2 is that
deferred idea, not a new one; `_instKey` was two parts (an unrelated `matKey` bug, THEN the real
hash-collision chase) and even the real fix (`2260aae`) needed a follow-up two days later
(`2c69478`) because a legacy fallback path kept the old broken scheme — added as an explicit
P6.2 requirement (retire fallback paths in the same change, don't leave zombie code); type-pair
memo had TWO distinct instant-0 incidents a day apart, not one; and the BVH LRU had a genuine
leak (`e2c064f`, stale keys not removed by _flushGeoCache, evicting real entries early) that
directly informs P6.1's ledger design. **Also discovered: `storageDetectCaches` (already in
safety-migrations.js, defaultEnabled:false) already contains an adaptive BVH cap + heap-pressure
relief — graduating that flag is now P6.1/P6.4's recommended step zero, cheaper than building
new.** BatchedMesh/InstancedMesh rollout's 9 follow-on fixes mined for specific failure
categories (bbox/instanceMatrix composition, serialization-must-read-pre-representation-source,
section-clip-sweep-must-cover-every-representation-type, picking-must-resolve-instance-not-
container) added as explicit P6.2 sub-requirements. `V7_RELEASE_PLAN.md` P6 updated accordingly;
PR #704 (draft).

**"Build all" pass, same day** — built everything from P6.1-P6.5 that's safe to ship without
live-browser verification or a Rust/WASM rebuild, explicit about what stays staged rather than
faking completeness (per this doc's own guardrail ledger: rushing geometry/rendering changes
without live verification is exactly what caused the chunk-merge saga):
- ~~**P6.1 shipped**~~ (2026-07-22): `_ccComputeResidencyLedger` (dedup-aware bytes: geometry,
  BatchedMesh, InstancedMesh incremental arrays, BVH cache, approx property size charged once
  per canonicalized reference). Auto-park now sorts by `reclaimableBytes` not element count; added
  a 20s park/restore cooldown (hysteresis). Did NOT graduate `storageDetectCaches` — that's a live
  eviction-behavior flag needing real soak, not flippable blind. `tests/residency-ledger.test.js` (16).
- ~~**P6.2 first slice shipped**~~: `_ccGetElementGeometry(el)` accessor (geometryId=geometry.uuid
  for now, becomes `geometryExpressID` once a real GeometryStore exists — never a derived hash,
  per the `_instKey` lesson); migrated exactly `_getWorldVerts`/`_getWorldTris` (clash engine) with
  numeric parity tests (identity/translation/multi-mesh/indexed cases, THREE stub since `three`
  isn't a node dep). The other ~39 call sites and dropping `element.meshes[]` are NOT done —
  staged multi-PR arc, unchanged from the plan. `tests/geometry-handle.test.js` (12).
- ~~**P6.3 conservative slice shipped**~~: pre-load pressure relief — `_ccLoadFiles` runs
  `_ccAutoParkPass()` one beat early when queueing a load, flag-gated (`memorySafeLoad`, default
  off, registered in `safety-migrations.js`). Deliberately does NOT reorder `loadIFCWorker`'s
  terminate-on-props timing or defer Three.js construction (the loader is explicitly high-care;
  no live verification possible here). `tests/memory-safe-load-wiring.test.js` (5).
- ~~**P6.4 safe slice shipped**~~: `_ccCommitDetectionResult(result, dispatch, detectionSettings,
  opts)` gains opt-in `opts.clearCachesAfter` → flushes BVH/world-vert caches post-run for the
  non-interactive run-and-export flow; wired through `ClashControl.runDetection(rulesOverride,
  opts)`. Off by default; verified no pre-existing call site passes a 4th arg. The real ask (a
  stateful WASM streaming cursor) needs a compiled Rust/WASM engine change — no toolchain, no
  live browser to verify a rebuild, explicitly NOT attempted. `tests/detection-cache-clear-wiring.test.js` (5).
- **P6.5 explicitly skipped**: its own gate ("only if P6.1 telemetry shows it's still a top-3
  contributor after P6.2 lands") is unmet — P6.2 only partially landed and there's zero real
  telemetry (no live browser ran the ledger against a real project). A reasoned skip, not an
  oversight.

Full suite 730→768 green across 4 new commits (one per task, per the type-pair-memo "one fix per
commit" guardrail); `index.html`/`safety-migrations.js` re-parse clean. **Nothing here has been
exercised in a real browser against a real multi-model project** — that remains the validation
gate before calling any of it done, same caveat as the original Park/Auto-park work. `V7_RELEASE_PLAN.md`
P6 gained a full implementation-status table; PR #704 updated from docs-only to include these
4 commits (still draft, pending CI + live validation).

~~**Real-browser validation achieved + PR #704 merged (2026-07-22, same day)**~~ — turns out
live browser testing IS possible here (was wrongly assumed impossible): Chromium is
pre-installed at `/opt/pw-browsers`; the existing `CC_BROWSER_OFFLINE_DEPS=1` mirror mode
serves React/Three/JSZip/pdf.js/web-ifc from local npm packages instead of the CDNs this
sandbox's proxy blocks. Ran the real `smoke.mjs` (13/13 real-browser checks green, including
the BatchedMesh identity checks that would catch a P6.2 regression) and built a new local
diagnostic, `tests/browser/memory-park-restore.mjs`, loading a 10,200-element synthetic
federation and driving real Park/Restore/Detection through the public API. Findings: element
counts matched exactly across load→park→restore→3 cycles (no data loss); but the ledger's
14.5MB estimate didn't map to a clean single-action heap delta (GC timing noise dominates at
that granularity), and the first restore after a park cost ~71MB, which shrank sharply on
repeated cycles (71→19→0.4MB) — consistent with one-time warm-up, not a compounding leak.
6 repeated detection runs showed net heap growth of 0 (actually -44MB). **PR #704 merged to
main** (all 11 CI checks green + this real-browser validation).

**P6.2 continuation, branch `claude/clashcontrol-v7-p6-2-continued`** — surveyed all ~40
remaining `element.meshes[]` call sites. Key finding: the "one consumer per commit" plan
undersold the remaining work's shape — most sites are NOT simple accessor swaps like the
first two. They split into: pure-read/accessor-compatible (now exhausted after clash-engine +
bbox); rendering-mutation consumers that fundamentally need a real Mesh reference
(`showModelDiff`/`clearModelDiff` material swap, `exportGLTF`/`exportSidecar` `.clone()`,
model-removal `.dispose()`) — these need a lazy Mesh-reconstruction GeometryStore, not a
read-only accessor, a bigger commitment than previously implied; `_geoSerialize` (accessor-
compatible but dedupes by MESH uuid not geometry uuid, needs local `matrix` not
`matrixWorld`, plus material color/opacity — getting any wrong silently corrupts the geo-cache,
deferred to a session that can budget a targeted hard-refresh round-trip test); section-cut
generation (historically the single most fragile category — "cuts nothing on batched models"
recurred twice — deferred without a visual/pixel check); and loader-internal/passthrough sites
(out of scope, not gaps). One real fix landed: NL "hide/isolate `<type>`" handlers
(`:32160`/`:32169`) redundantly iterated meshes for `mesh.userData.expressId` when
`el.expressId` already carries it — fixed, zero behavior change (both consumers already fold
into a set), `tests/nl-hide-isolate-expressid.test.js`. Full suite 774→777 green; re-verified
in a real browser (smoke.mjs 13/13). `V7_RELEASE_PLAN.md` P6.2 updated with this architectural
correction.

**v7 release-validation plan (branch `claude/clashcontrol-v7-release-plan-jp5njw`)** (2026-07-22) —  **[STALE?]**
built `V7_RELEASE_PLAN.md` from an external re-review of v7.2.7/`b195655`, with every
load-bearing claim re-verified against source. Confirmed the real release blocker is
**local-engine result parity** (capability gate at `local-engine.js:767` doesn't catch:
raw model-selector forwarding vs. engine exact `model_id` match → silent 0; `useSemanticFilter`
+ `excludeSameDiscipline` defaults neither serialized nor client-re-applied → over-report;
per-pair tolerance > `maxGap` under-detects; `excludeTypePairs` array-vs-map inconsistency at
`:1274` vs `:807`). Also confirmed: 96-byte candidate diagnostic mis-applied to the compact
Wasm path (`:6464`/`:6972`), non-atomic shared-project CAS (`api/project.js:234`), no real IFC
corpus. **Corrected two review errors:** CI *is* green (run `29866854575` on `e0e356b` — test/
browser-smoke/browser-differential all ✅; reviewer looked at the bot bump tip `b195655` that the
`changes` gate skips), and the defaults live at `:1274` not `:1008`. Plan is P0–P5 with binary
acceptance gates; complements `IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`.
**P0.1–P0.5 implemented this session** (browser-side, no Engine dependency): core `pick()`
hoisted to `window._ccResolveModelScope` + addon `_normalizeModelScope` (scopes resolve to
'all'|single-id|fail-closed); local path re-applies `window._ccMatrixSkipsSameDiscipline`
against resolved elements for exact excludeSameDiscipline/disciplineMatrix parity;
`_clashFromEngineResult` now classifies discipline per-element; gate fails closed for
changeAware, per-pair tolerance wider than maxGap, semantic filter (only when excludeSelf
off — default runs stay local), and non-'all'/single scopes; `excludeTypePairs` consumed
as a Set from the array (was indexed as a map → never fired). Tests 13→27, full suite 699
green; index.html main script re-parses clean.
**Continued (same session): P0.6 unit parity suite** `tests/local-engine-parity.test.js`
(local rule pipeline vs. an independent browser-semantics reference, 11-ruleset matrix +
anchors); **P1.3** compact-candidate byte accounting — `_candidateSetBytes` distinguishes
eager (96 B/pair) from compact-Wasm (12 B/pair + item table), report gains
`candidates_representation`; **P5.1** `api/project.js` now does a single-statement atomic
CAS (`ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE ... WHERE updated_at <= expected`, conflicts from RETURNING)
instead of read-then-unconditional-upsert; **P1.1 (Engine repo, PR #26)** `/status` now
advertises `protocolVersion` + a `capabilities` rule map (honors mode/maxGap/minGap/
excludeSelf/excludeTypePairs, modelScope 'exact'; everything else False). ClashControl
suite 699→713 green; engine suite 94 green. ClashControl PR #701, Engine PR #26 (both draft).
**Still open (documented in V7_RELEASE_PLAN.md): P0.6 e2e geometry fixture, browser half of
P1.1 (capability consumer), P1.2 engine volume/semantic geometry, P2 real corpus (needs
licensed IFC), P3 malformed-IFC, P4 BCF import fidelity, P0-infra branch protection.**

~~**Storage/memory optimization campaign (Loam-inspired "explicit retention"), branch
`claude/clashcontrol-memory-optimization-jht2yy`)** (2026-07-19)~~ — all seven phases landed:
P1 `storage-core.js` (UMD, registry with explicit retention classes source/derived/decay/prefs,
byte estimation, report shaping) + `_ccStorageReport()`/`ClashControl.storage.*` + Settings
Privacy & Data "Local storage" section; P2 budget enforcement (`computeBudget` = min(pref, 80%
quota), auto-GC of the derived geoCache tier oldest/cold-first, ifcFiles only ever
user-confirmed proposals, QuotaExceeded evict-and-retry on both IDB writers); P3a
`storageAutosaveGate` flag (identity-memo skip of clean 2s autosaves; pagehide/switch flush
forced); P4 `_ccLsSet` quota-aware setter + cc_denied_clashes cap (500) + one
`_ccDeleteProjectStorage` (both deleteProject copies orphaned chat keys) + boot prune of expired
typePairMemo/orphan chat keys + revit-bridge hash-cache 20k persist cap; P5a `_trainFV` stripped
from IDB + .ccproject persist (NOT `_pairResultCache` — changeAware re-emits cached records
verbatim, slimming them changes detection output); P6 `storageDetectCaches` flag (deviceMemory-
informed BVH LRU cap where performance.memory is absent — was flat 300 on Safari/FF — plus
85%-heap between-chunk LRU halving; element-major candidate reordering NOT done, needs profile
timings first) + unflagged `_flushGeoCache` stale-LRU-key leak fix; P7
`tests/storage-registry-wiring.test.js` pins every cc_* key + IDB store to the registry. Suite
640 green; browser smoke extended (storage report + both new flags opted in) and passing.

~~**Rust/WASM broad-phase sweep (Phase 4, the deferred core) — built, measured before/after,
kept** (branch `claude/cc-claims-review-myhp9f`, 2026-07-17)~~ — user explicitly directed doing
the Rust rewrite this session had deferred, with an explicit protocol: "test it locally before
and after... if it's worse or fails, fix it or revert it." New `engine/src/broadphase.rs`
(`sweep_and_prune`, +21 Rust unit tests) ports `_sweepAndPrune`'s geometric sweep (axis-variance
selection, stable sort, sliding-window AABB active-list scan) to Rust — **deliberately not the
self-clash rule's business logic**, which has three different possible input shapes
(`selfClashModels`/`selfClashGroup`/`excludeSelf`) and stays in JS, resolved once per unique
model into a simple `sameModelAllowed[modelIdx]` lookup flag before crossing into Rust; Rust
only ever sees "same-model pairs in model M: allowed or not," never the rule shapes, so a
subtle port bug in that business logic isn't structurally possible. Wired as
`window._ccWasmSweepAndPrune`, called first with the existing `_sweepAndPrune` as fallback/
oracle when WASM is unavailable — matches the `_ccWasmIntersect` pattern exactly. WASM binary
43KB (was ~35KB), within the 100KB budget in `scripts/test-wasm-engine.sh` (also updated that
script's stale export-check list to include the new function).
**Verified, per the explicit before/after instruction:**
- New `tests/browser/wasm-sweep-differential.mjs`: runs detection twice per rule configuration
  in the same page (WASM path, then `window._ccWasmSweepAndPrune` stubbed out to force the JS
  fallback) across 8 configurations spanning every self-clash rule shape
  (`selfClashModels:'all'/'none'`, `selfClashGroup:'a'`, legacy `excludeSelf`, `duplicates`),
  cross-model federation, and type exclusion — **all 8 produce byte-identical clash sets**
  (order-independent, by element-pair identity). One case (cross-model federation) initially
  showed both paths agreeing at 0 clashes — investigated rather than assumed-fine: not a WASM
  bug, both fixtures auto-detect the same discipline and `excludeSameDiscipline` (default true,
  applied downstream of the sweep) was filtering everything; fixed the test's rule override, re-
  ran, both paths then agreed at 2 clashes.
- Performance (ad hoc synthetic-element construction via direct `ADD_MODEL` dispatch, bypassing
  IFC parsing, to get a genuinely dense candidate-generating cluster — the generator's normal
  wall spacing doesn't overlap by design): 3000 densely-clustered elements → 63,725 candidates,
  **identical candidate count between WASM and JS** — `sweep_and_prune_ms` median **22ms (WASM)
  vs 83ms (JS), a 3.77x speedup**, 5 runs each. Small/sparse case (50 elements, 14 candidates):
  both sub-millisecond, no measurable regression from WASM call overhead.
- Full regression: 615/615 Node unit tests, 21/21 Rust unit tests, full `smoke.mjs`, the
  existing 7-case IFC worker/fallback differential harness, and `scripts/test-wasm-engine.sh`
  all green.
**Verdict: kept, not reverted** — correctness matched exactly across every tested configuration
and performance measurably improved with no regression found at any scale tested. Scope note:
this moves the expensive geometric PRODUCTION of candidates to Rust; the JS side still decodes
the flat WASM output back into the same `{eA,mA,eB,mB,sameModel}` pair-object array
`_sweepAndPrune` always returned, so **this is a real, measured speedup, not (yet) the
"never materialize all candidates in JavaScript" memory win** the original plan's Phase 4 also
asks for — that would require changing the candidate-*consuming* code (`_processCandidate`/
`_runChunk`) to read the flat index arrays directly, a separate, larger follow-up.

~~**Browser-first large-model plan, Phases 3-7 checked against project history and adjusted;
Phase 4 partial slice shipped (candidate-count warning)** (branch `claude/cc-claims-review-myhp9f`,
2026-07-17)~~ — same-session follow-up completing the "check the whole plan against history"
pass the user asked for (Phase 2's check covered the chunk-merge saga; this extends that same
audit through the rest of the plan before writing any more code).
- **Phase 3 (eliminate the dual scene representation) — REJECTED as specified, not merely
  deferred.** Re-read the current BatchedMesh architecture: it is deliberately scoped to
  pathological models only (`geoUnique/elements > 10 OR >20k meshes/model`), and the ORIGINAL
  per-element meshes are kept off-scene as proxies specifically because that's "the proven
  Stage 2A pattern" that ended the chunk-merge crisis (`element.meshes[]` stays the source of
  truth for clash/serialize/outline/selection). Phase 3 of the external plan asks to remove
  exactly this proxy pattern ("BatchedMesh as sole authoritative render source... rewrite
  selection/visibility/coloring/section/serialization/clash adapters to use handles instead of
  retained off-scene meshes") in the name of a claimed 35-50% peak-heap reduction. That is not
  a neutral architecture change — it is reintroducing the precise failure class (many call
  sites silently unaware of a non-1:1 element↔mesh mapping) that took this project multiple
  emergency-enable/revert cycles to escape, for a subsystem this codebase's own history says is
  correct as built. Do not build this. If peak memory in pathological-batched models genuinely
  needs to come down further, target it narrowly (e.g. only within the already-batched subset)
  rather than removing the safety net for every model.
- **Phase 4 (Rust/WASM clash kernel)** — no negative precedent found (no prior failed attempt
  at a similar rewrite). The Rust crate (`engine/`, `clashcontrol-engine`, ~720 lines) already
  lives in this repo, so it's technically reachable. But its real payoff — moving broad-phase/
  candidate-generation/narrow-phase into Rust with streamed results — means rewriting the
  tri-tri/BVH intersection math (`_rayTriHit`, `_bvhRayCount`, `_closestPtTriDistSq`,
  `_bvhClosestDistSq`, etc.) and the WASM boundary contract together. `CLAUDE.md` names this
  exact code "geometrically sensitive... not to be touched without good reason" — a different,
  more serious caution than the loader work this session already did (which had the
  differential-fingerprint harness as a safety net; a numerically-sensitive geometry rewrite
  needs its own dedicated tolerance/regression-test design, not a same-session add-on). **Built
  the one genuinely safe, JS-only slice that doesn't touch that math:** `_sweepAndPrune`'s
  broad-phase output (`candidates`) is still a single fully-materialized JS array (unchanged —
  eliminating that materialization is itself a real control-flow rewrite of the chunked
  execution harness, deferred alongside the tri-tri work), but detection now warns (a
  non-blocking `window._ccToast`, not `confirm()` — detection can fire from non-interactive
  triggers like AI/NL commands or auto-run, where a blocking dialog nobody's watching for would
  hang the run) when that array crosses 1,000,000 pairs, reusing the `_CANDIDATE_EST_BYTES`
  estimate already built this session for the perf harness. Same "tell the user, don't silently
  do something surprising" principle as the storey-scan truncation lock. Verified: 615/615 unit
  tests (5 new wiring-lock tests in `tests/large-candidate-warning.test.js`, same source-pattern-
  matching style as `storey-scope-wiring.test.js` — the check lives deep inside the large
  detection function alongside real dependencies not worth mocking for five lines), full
  `smoke.mjs` green (confirms normal-scale detection, below the threshold, is unaffected).
- **Phase 5 (COOP/COEP + multithreading)** — no negative precedent found (never attempted).
  Confirmed again this session (see the Phase 1/2 entries below and the original plan-review
  entry): `vercel.json` has no `headers` block at all, ~18 external CDN references in
  `index.html` would need a self-hosting/pinning audit first. Real, bounded infrastructure/
  deployment work — no code-correctness risk once done, but a full asset audit is its own task,
  not attempted here.
- **Phase 6 (500MB+ operating mode) and Phase 7 (native fallback)** — both explicitly depend on
  Phases 2-5 landing first per the plan's own sequencing; nothing new to adjust or build ahead
  of that.
- Explicitly did NOT open a new PR-per-slice this time (user feedback after Phases 1/2 each got
  their own PR+merge in quick succession) — this batch is one commit on the branch, held for a
  single PR/merge decision rather than an immediate autonomous merge.

~~**Browser-first large-model plan, Phase 2 adjusted by project history + safely-scoped slice
shipped: storey-scope auto-background-complete** (branch `claude/cc-claims-review-myhp9f`,
2026-07-17)~~ — same-session follow-up to Phase 1 below. User explicitly asked to check the
plan against project git/MEMORY history before continuing — this surfaced a directly relevant,
previously-undocumented-in-this-context precedent: **the chunk-merge saga.** A 2026-06-xx
attempt to cut draw calls (2,510 elements / 74,772 unique geometries → ~75k meshes, one
cladding model) by hand-merging many meshes into fewer BufferGeometry "chunks" went through
multiple emergency-enable/revert cycles (`f6e7a9e` emergency-enable → `d10194f`/`1a43021`
reverts) before being **removed entirely** (`704837f`) — root cause per MEMORY's own
retrospective: "hand-rolled chunk-merge on r128 broke identity features — same-material
elements visually blended, render-style switch no-op on chunks, selection outlines blended,
hide/color needed index-rebuild registries, ~49 setters never became chunk-aware." It only
succeeded later, replaced by native `THREE.BatchedMesh` (a primitive that didn't exist during
the earlier attempts) with an explicit staged rollout (Phase 0 acceptance gates → Phase 1
narrow trigger → Phase 2 regression-test every historical revert symptom in CI *before* any
default-on expansion) and by keeping original per-element meshes off-scene as proxies so
identity-dependent code never had to change. **Applied lesson to Phase 2 of the large-model
plan:** the plan's actual headline ask — progressive rendering ("render the first safe batch
immediately... build bounds/Navigator rows as chunks arrive") — means exposing a
partially-loaded `model.elements`/`model.meshes` to the reducer and every consumer that reads
it (Navigator, storey list, Issues panel, BCF export preconditions, detection triggers,
search...) — structurally the SAME "many things must all become aware of a not-yet-complete
data model" pattern that took this project multiple failed attempts to get right for a
narrower, rendering-only version of the problem. Separately researched (before this history
check) that `web-ifc`'s `StreamAllMeshes` has no cooperative-yield hook, so true worker-side
backpressure would require manually reproducing its element-selection semantics via per-ID
`GetFlatMesh` calls — a real correctness risk on top of the UI blast-radius risk. **Decision:
do NOT build a general incremental/partial-loading data model this session.** Instead shipped
the safe equivalent of Phase 2's "prioritize selected storeys... while allowing complete
background decode" bullet by chaining two ALREADY-PROVEN one-shot primitives instead of
inventing a new partial state:
- `StoreyScopeModal` gets a new opt-in checkbox (shown only for a genuine partial selection,
  never for "Load all"): "Load the rest automatically in the background once this finishes."
  When checked, the file's name is registered in `window._ccAutoCompleteScopedLoads`; once the
  scoped load settles, the existing (already-tested) `window._ccReloadModelFull` — the exact
  function behind the pre-existing manual "partial load" badge button — is auto-triggered, with
  no new data-model concept: the user sees the scoped subset immediately (today's existing
  behavior, unchanged), then a second ordinary one-shot full load runs and `REPLACE_MODEL`s it
  in when done, exactly as if they'd clicked the manual button themselves.
- **Two real bugs found and fixed while wiring this, both by the new browser test actually
  driving the flow rather than trusting the code read** (`tests/browser/storey-scope-auto-
  complete.mjs`): (1) a race — `_ccReloadModelFull` reads the file straight back out of
  IndexedDB, but the auto-trigger fired before the scoped load's own `idbSaveFile` write had
  landed (fire-and-forget promise), so the reload silently no-op'd with "Original file not
  found." Fixed by chaining the trigger onto the persist promise instead of firing synchronously.
  (2) A **pre-existing latent bug in `_ccReloadModelFull` itself**, not introduced by this
  session: `window._ccLoadFiles` routes through `maybeScopeThenProcess` like any other load
  trigger, so reloading a multi-storey file in full — via EITHER the pre-existing manual badge
  button OR the new auto-trigger — with the storey-chooser flag on would re-open the SAME scope
  picker instead of loading in full, silently stalling forever with nothing to confirm it. Fixed
  generally (not just for the new feature) with a one-shot `window._ccSkipScopeCheckOnce` flag
  that `_ccReloadModelFull` sets and `maybeScopeThenProcess` consumes. This bug had never
  manifested because `ccUiStoreyChooser` currently defaults off in production — it was latent,
  waiting for the flag to ever be exercised.
- Verified: 610/610 unit tests (4 new + 1 updated in `tests/storey-scope-wiring.test.js`), full
  `smoke.mjs` green, existing `storey-scope-truncated.mjs` unaffected, the new
  `storey-scope-auto-complete.mjs` drives the real flow end-to-end in a real browser (partial
  load appears first with the correct skipped-element count, then the full model auto-replaces
  it with `loadedScope` cleared, registry consumed exactly once).
- **Explicitly NOT done, and why:** true progressive/incremental rendering (a partially-loaded
  model visible to the UI mid-stream) and worker-side backpressure remain unbuilt. If ever
  attempted, follow the SAME pattern this project's own history proves works: build the
  primitive first behind an explicit flag, audit every `model.elements`/`model.meshes` consumer
  first (there could easily be 49+, mirroring the chunk-merge count for a narrower problem),
  write a regression test for every failure mode BEFORE any default-on rollout, and prefer
  leaning on a native/existing primitive over hand-rolling incremental-awareness across dozens

~~**Browser-first large-model plan, Phase 1 completed: IFC worker protocol v2 (packed
rawEls)** (branch `claude/cc-claims-review-myhp9f`, 2026-07-17)~~ — same-session follow-up
to the tranche below, completing Phase 1 of the plan (the dominant measured cost: ~73%-of-
Scene-build `transferGap`, per prior-session `sceneSub` instrumentation). Replaced the IFC
worker's `rawEls` wire format — v1 was one JS object per element (`{expressId, geos:[...],
props:{...}}`, each geometry placement its own nested object) sent over `postMessage` and
structured-cloned in full — with `packedEls`: a structure-of-arrays encoding (element-parallel
typed arrays for expressId/geoCount/typeId/axis; placement-flat typed arrays for
geoId/color/16-float transforms, fed straight into `THREE.Matrix4.fromArray(arr, offset)` with
no per-placement copy; a deduplicated string table + index arrays for the three highly
repetitive per-element string fields — ifcType/storey/material — with globalId/name/
description/objectType left as plain flat string arrays since those are near-unique per
element and interning would only add index-indirection overhead there). Quantities/psets are
deliberately NOT encoded — traced and confirmed the worker's primary streaming path always
had `propMap` empty at that point (`if(pm){...}` was provably dead code, always false; the real
psets/quantities arrive later via the separate lazy "Phase 2" `buildPropertyMap` message,
unchanged) — the decoder reconstructs `quantities:{}, psets:{}` directly, identical to what
that always-false branch left in place. `IFC_WORKER_PROTOCOL_VERSION` bumped 1→2. **Measured
improvement** (same 25k-element synthetic fixture, before/after via `git stash` on `index.html`
only, same sandbox, same run): `sceneSub.transferGap` 4128ms→2218ms (**46% reduction**), total
load time 7663ms→5972ms (**22% reduction**, ~1.7s saved). Residual `transferGap` is now
dominated by `geoTable`'s own one-object-per-unique-geometry shape (unchanged this pass, and
this particular fixture is a worst case with zero geometry reuse — 25,000/25,000 unique) — a
separate, already-known concern, not `rawEls`. Verified: 606/606 unit tests, full `smoke.mjs`
green, and critically **all 7 differential-harness cases (the 6-fixture matrix + cancellation)
still fingerprint-identical between worker and fallback** after the rewrite — re-run twice,
once against the new code directly and once again after a stash/pop round-trip to confirm the
comparison methodology itself was sound. **Not done this session (explicitly deferred, matches
the plan's own phase gates):** Phase 2 (progressive chunked loading with backpressure, honest
storey-scope preflight), Phase 3 (eliminate the dual scene representation — BatchedMesh as
sole authoritative render source, rewrite selection/visibility/coloring/section/serialization/
clash adapters to use handles instead of retained off-scene meshes), Phase 4 (move the clash
hot path into the Rust/WASM kernel — the crate lives in-repo at `engine/` [`clashcontrol-engine`,
~720 lines across `lib.rs`/`bvh.rs`/`tri_tri.rs`/`spatial_hash.rs`], so this is technically
in-scope for a future session, just not attempted here), Phase 5 (COOP/COEP — confirmed
`vercel.json` has no `headers` block at all; ~18 external CDN references in `index.html` alone
would need self-hosting/pinning audit first), Phases 6-7. Each has its own explicit
measurement/oracle-comparison gate in the plan and is sequenced for its own session, not a
same-session follow-on to Phase 1.

~~**Browser-first large-model plan, first implementation tranche: harness extension +
zero-copy input-buffer transfer** (branch `claude/cc-claims-review-myhp9f`, 2026-07-17)~~ —
same-session follow-up to the plan review below, executed in the order that review's
adjustment #4 called for (expand differential coverage *before* touching the loader's
transfer protocol, per `REDUCER_DECOMPOSITION_PLAN.md`'s loader-area high-risk/last
sequencing). All four pieces of the recommended first step, plus the harness extension the
review's adjustment #3 called for:
- **Worker/fallback differential coverage expanded** — `ifc-worker-fallback-differential.mjs`
  went from one hardcoded two-wall fixture to a 6-case matrix (baseline, multi-storey,
  quantities, millimetre unit conversion, IFC4 georeferencing, a deliberately null-valued
  "degenerate" property record) via new opt-in `generate-synthetic-ifc.js` extensions
  (`withQuantities`, `withPsets`, `lengthUnit`, `geo`, `mapConversion` — all default-off,
  verified byte-identical output when omitted). Caught and fixed two real bugs while building
  this: (1) a malformed STEP real-number literal in the elevation field (`10.5.` — double
  decimal point, invalid EXPRESS/STEP syntax) in the generator itself, and (2) the comparison
  only checked `modelFingerprint()`, which doesn't cover unit scale/georef/mapConversion at
  all — a worker/fallback divergence limited to those fields would have passed silently.
  Extended the comparison to the full result payload. **Open finding, not investigated
  further (out of scope for this session, flagged for later):** the georeferencing case's
  `RefLatitude`/`RefLongitude` compound values come back as `null` from `extractSpatialHierarchy`
  on BOTH the worker and fallback paths (identically — so parity holds, this is not a
  divergence) — could be a fixture-format mismatch or a real latent bug in `_compoundToDeg`;
  `RefElevation` (a plain REAL, not compound) parses correctly. All 6 cases green.
- **Candidate-count / peak-candidate-memory metrics** — `profile.candidates` (element-pair
  count) already existed; added `candidates_est_bytes` (documented ~96B/candidate estimate,
  `_CANDIDATE_EST_BYTES` in index.html — explicitly labelled an approximation, not a measured
  value) and surfaced both plus `sweepAndPruneMs`/`bvhBuildMs` into `perf-local.mjs`'s captured
  metrics, closing the plan's Phase 0 "candidate count" measurement ask without a new harness.
- **Corpus manifest + real-file plumbing** — `tests/fixtures/CORPUS_MANIFEST.md` documents the
  plan's 50/150/300/500/750+MB tiers, the never-commit-real-IFC-files rule, and how to point
  `perf-local.mjs`/`memory-local.mjs` at a real external file via new `CC_PERF_FIXTURE_PATH`
  (served from a fixed, narrow, operator-controlled route — not the containment-guarded generic
  file server, never derived from request input) with an auto-scaled load timeout
  (`CC_PERF_LOAD_TIMEOUT_MS`, default 600s for corpus files). Verified against a synthetic
  100-element fixture through the real plumbing (not just code review).
- **`load-cancel-load-loop.mjs`** — new harness covering the plan's Phase 0 ask for
  load-cancel-load + model-removal loop tests with a memory-plateau assertion (heap +
  whole-process RSS via `/proc`, forced GC between samples). 5 cycles on a single persistent
  page (not fresh-browser-per-cycle, so it can actually see a leak accumulate). Caught and
  fixed a real bug while writing it: the Worker-stub restoration used `delete window.Worker`
  expecting a prototype-chain fallback that browser globals don't have — every cycle after the
  first would have silently kept using the broken stub. Fixed by saving the real constructor
  once before the loop. Verified plateau: heap 1.02-1.03x, RSS 1.01-1.02x cycle-1→cycle-4 (well
  under the 1.5x threshold). Repeated-federation and five-consecutive-project-opens (the plan's
  other two Phase 0 asks) are explicitly NOT covered — documented as a gap in
  `CORPUS_MANIFEST.md`, not silently subsumed.
- **Zero-copy transfer for the IFC input buffer** (Phase 1, item 1 of the plan's recommended
  first tranche) — `worker.postMessage({buffer,...}, [buffer])` now transfers instead of
  structured-clones the input `ArrayBuffer` (`index.html` `loadIFCWorker`). Handled the
  necessary consequence the plan itself flagged ("a transferred buffer is detached"): the
  outer `buf` is used THREE times after the worker call in the caller (main-thread fallback
  re-parse, `idbSaveFile` persistence, and a `fileSize` fallback read) — all three now
  reacquire fresh bytes from the source `File` (`f.arrayBuffer()`, a local re-read, not a
  network fetch) instead of touching the now-detached `buf`. Verified via the expanded
  6-case differential harness (fingerprint-identical worker vs. fallback on every case,
  including the forced-fallback path that exercises the reacquisition code directly) plus
  full `smoke.mjs` (including its own pre-existing "expected worker failure falls back"
  case) and 606/606 unit tests — all green.
- Explicitly NOT attempted this session (deferred per the plan's own gating and
  `REDUCER_DECOMPOSITION_PLAN.md`'s risk ordering): the `rawEls` protocol-v2 packed-typed-array
  change (the dominant ~73%-of-Scene-build cost) and anything from Phase 2 onward. Those need
  their own session with the now-wider differential net as the safety gate, not a same-session
  follow-on to building that gate.

~~**External browser-first large-model plan verified against code + history** (branch
`claude/cc-claims-review-myhp9f`, 2026-07-17)~~ — a user-supplied external plan
("ClashControl browser-first IFC and clash-engine plan", reviewed at `23bde34`/v7.2.1) was
claim-checked line-by-line against `index.html`, the addons, tests, `vercel.json`, and git
history. **Verdict: overwhelmingly accurate — adopt with four adjustments.** Every loading
pressure point confirmed in code: input buffer `postMessage` at index.html:4441 has NO transfer
list (structured clone); worker returns geometry buffers as Transferables but `rawEls` (one JS
object per element) is structured-cloned (the measured ~73%-of-Scene-build cost); per-element
`THREE.Mesh` objects are retained off-scene in `element.meshes[]` AFTER Instanced/BatchedMesh
build (explicit design comment ~index.html:3365) — dual representation confirmed; storey-scan
512MB ceiling + `truncated` picker lock confirmed. Clash side confirmed: broad phase
(`_sweepAndPrune`) is main-thread with `.filter()` active arrays and a fully-materialized
candidate array; `_DETECT_CHUNK_SIZE=80` setTimeout chunking; per-element (not per-unique-
geometry) world-space tri copies + BVHs in the adaptive `_bvhLRU`; WASM batch path concat-copies
triangles (`_runBatch` → `allTris.set`); local-engine bridge POSTs plain-number JSON verts.
**Adjustments to the plan:** (1) its "BVHs are rebuilt too often" is overstated — BVHs are
LRU-cached and the WASM hard path uses no BVH at all; the real per-call cost is the concat
copies + per-element world-tri duplication. (2) Its "full properties assembled into a large map"
is only eager on the FALLBACK path — the worker path already defers `buildPropertyMap` to a
post-render Phase 2 and merges per-element. (3) Phase 0 "build the harness" should be "EXTEND
the harness" — perf-local.mjs (phases+RSS), memory-local.mjs (plateaus, forced GC),
`modelFingerprint`/`clashFingerprint`, and the worker/fallback differential harness already
exist; missing pieces are a real-model corpus, candidate-count metrics, and load-cancel-load
loop tests. (4) Its protocol-v2 work must be reconciled with the `.toString()`-assembled worker
(see the 2026-07-17 static-file-extraction Known Issue) and REDUCER_DECOMPOSITION_PLAN.md's  **[STALE?]**
loader-area high-risk/last sequencing — expand differential coverage FIRST. **Doc drift found
and fixed: CLAUDE.md claimed `vercel.json` sets COOP/COEP headers — verified FALSE (no `headers`
block at all; no COOP/COEP anywhere; three.js/web-ifc load from jsdelivr via dynamic ESM with no
SRI; sw.js deliberately skips web-ifc interception citing CORP/COEP). The app is NOT
cross-origin isolated in production; SharedArrayBuffer/threaded WASM would be genuinely new
deployment work, exactly as the external plan says.** 606/606 unit tests green at review time;
no app code changed this session (docs only).

~~**External-review follow-up: grouped conflict-list memoization, storey-scan completeness,
large-model profiling correction** (branch `claude/findings-and-plan`, 2026-07-17)~~ — a second
external review of the merged PR #692 correctly identified two real, verified bugs and asked for
deeper large-model profiling; see the two 2026-07-17 Known Issues entries above for the profiling  **[STALE?]**
correction (a genuine fixture-generator bug, not an app performance number, was hiding behind the
original "174s" figure) and `git log` on this branch for the two code fixes:
(1) `groupAndSort()` in `VirtualList` (index.html) was called unmemoized in the render body,
invalidating every downstream `useMemo` (including the offset-table memoization from the earlier
windowed-list work) on every scroll-driven re-render for grouped/sorted lists — now memoized with
stable deps, locked with a real-browser test that drives 100 actual scroll updates and asserts
call counts stay flat (not just that a `useMemo` exists in the source — verified the test catches
the regression by reverting only the fix and confirming 100/100/100 calls). (2) The storey-scope
chooser's pre-scan stopped early once a few chunks added nothing new, which could silently miss a
real storey defined late in a file (IFC-SPF entity order isn't guaranteed) — now always scans the
full file (bounded-memory regardless of length, so only cost is time not memory), and reports
`truncated:true` + locks the picker to full-load-only when a file exceeds the (now much larger,
512MB) byte ceiling, so a user can never silently scope down to an incomplete list. Verified:
606/606 unit tests, full real-Chromium smoke green throughout (including regenerating the
committed `multi-storey-smoke.ifc` fixture, which had the same schema defect as the profiling
bug — too small for the defect's cost to be visible in existing tests, but still invalid IFC).

~~**Export-view-as-PDF: markup redlines silently missing from the exported popup** (branch
`claude/findings-and-plan`, 2026-07-17)~~ — found via the user's own live testing on the PR #692 Vercel
preview (drew a redline rectangle + arrow, exported as PDF, the exported popup showed the clean model with
no markup at all). Root cause: `window._ccExportViewPDF` (`index.html`) looks for the live markup `<svg>`
overlay via `renderer.domElement.parentElement.querySelector(':scope > svg')` to clone it into the export
popup — but the canvas's *immediate* parent is the ref `<div>` Three.js appends into
(`el.appendChild(renderer.domElement)`, `Viewer`'s mount effect); the markup `<svg>` is a **sibling of that
div**, one level further up, under `Viewer`'s own outer wrapper. The one-level-shallow lookup always
resolved to `null`, so `svgMarkup` was always `''` — every PDF export silently dropped redlines, this whole
time. (The separate "Save Viewpoint" feature was unaffected — `_ccSnapshotWithRedlines` bakes markups
directly into the raster PNG via canvas 2D drawing, a different, correct mechanism.) Fixed by walking up one
more level (`renderer.domElement.parentElement.parentElement`) before the `:scope > svg` query. Verified by
reproducing the bug against the pre-fix code first (confirmed the popup really was missing the markup),
then confirming the fix resolves it — both via a real-Chromium check that injects a labelled test `<rect>`
into the live markup SVG, triggers the export, and asserts the popup's DOM contains it. Folded into
`tests/browser/smoke.mjs` (reusing the already-loaded model rather than a second browser session). 605/605
unit tests + full smoke green.

~~**Reducer/state decomposition — Slice 1 (prefs-persistence consolidation) + full write-up of the rest;
50MB large-model measurement; Claude-Desktop-style tabbed Settings menu** (branch `claude/findings-and-plan`,
2026-07-17)~~ — same-day follow-up to the entry below. Reducer decomposition: consolidated ~8 duplicated
inline `try{localStorage.setItem(...)}catch(e){}` reducer case branches onto the already-existing
`_ccPersistUI` helper (first draft wrongly introduced a new `prefs-persistence.js` file before noticing the
existing helper already covered the shape — reverted, consolidated in place instead); `UPD_PREFS`'s inline
key array became the named `PERSISTED_PREF_KEYS` constant; `TRAINING_MODE`'s raw `'1'`/`'0'` format
deliberately left untouched (folding it into the JSON-shaped helper would silently change the stored
format for existing users). Verified with a new characterization test
(`tests/prefs-persistence-consolidation.test.js`) plus a real-browser dispatch-and-read-`localStorage`
check. Full remaining scope (cache invalidation, `_gcEvent` analytics reach, `INIT`-side persistence
reads, IndexedDB, event wiring, loader/worker lifecycle, then finally the reducer's own transition logic)
written up in `REDUCER_DECOMPOSITION_PLAN.md`, ordered by risk × blast-radius with explicit standing
rules (characterization tests first, real-browser verification after every slice, don't add a new
file/abstraction without checking for an existing fit, one area per slice). Large-model measurement:
see the 2026-07-17 Known Issues entry above — 174s/2.5GB peak RSS for a 145,670-element synthetic  **[STALE?]**
53.67MB fixture, explicitly caveated as entity-count stress testing, not representative of a typical
real-world 50MB file. **Settings menu retrofit** (a standing, previously-unfulfilled request): `SettingsModal`
(`index.html`, was one long single-scroll list of ~8 `SEC` groupings) is now a left-sidebar tab rail +
scrolling content pane, matching Claude Desktop's settings layout — General / Measurement / Walk mode /
Privacy & Data / Shared Project / AI / Issues / Advanced, each tab wrapping its existing section content
in a `${activeTab==='x' && html\`<${React.Fragment}>...\`}` conditional (no section content itself changed,
only the chrome around it). The "Advanced" tab wires in `AdvancedSettingsTab` (the type-pair tolerance
matrix) — that component existed fully built with zero call sites anywhere in the file before this session;
it's real, tested functionality that had simply never been mounted. **Bonus fix found and fixed while
testing this in a real browser with no model loaded:** `WelcomePopup`'s ("Open a model." empty-state) fixed
full-viewport wrapper used the same `zIndex:50` as every modal's `S_BACKDROP`; same-z-index ties resolve by
DOM order, and the welcome card's wrapper happened to win, silently eating clicks meant for the Settings
modal (and, by extension, presumably any modal) whenever it was showing underneath — verified this predates
this session's changes by running the same real-browser click-interception check against the last committed
`index.html`. Fixed by dropping `WelcomePopup` to `zIndex:20` (still above ambient canvas-level overlays,
which top out around `zIndex:11`, but below every modal). Verified: 605/605 unit tests, full real-Chromium
smoke (new settings-tabs assertions folded into `tests/browser/smoke.mjs` right after the existing
model-load step, reusing that session rather than spinning up a second browser) green throughout, plus a
manual real-browser check at a 375px mobile viewport confirming the modal renders above `WelcomePopup` and
every tab remains clickable.

~~**Toolbar retrofit fixed and merged; external-review findings fixed; six clash-pipeline cores
graduated to sole implementation** (branch `claude/findings-and-plan`, 2026-07-17)~~ — follow-up to
the two entries below. Toolbar: root-caused the "flexbox overlap" that got Phase 8's toolbar retrofit
reverted — it was a `getBoundingClientRect()` false positive (a child clipped by `overflow:hidden`
still reports its full unclipped layout geometry; a screenshot showed no actual visual collision) with
a *real* bug hiding underneath (a bare `minWidth:0` let the group shrink thinner than its own forced-
visible active item + "More" toggle need, silently making the whole cluster unreachable). Fixed with a
`worstCaseFloor` constant derived from `items` alone — an interim fix that derived the floor from the
current render's `fit` decision instead created a closed measurement/render feedback loop that
permanently disabled shrinking; caught by re-testing and finding the group had stopped collapsing at
all. Wired into `TopToolbar`'s CAMERA cluster behind `ccUiToolbarV2` (still default off), merged as
PR #691. External-review findings, each independently verified against the code before fixing: deleted
the dead `ccUiConsentBanner` flag; memoized the windowed conflict list's row-offset table (was
recomputed on every scroll-driven render, real avoidable CPU work at 50k+ conflicts —
`winForceTick`, already bumped exactly when a real height measurement changes, is the correct `useMemo`
dependency); replaced the storey chooser's `ifcFile.text()` (decoded the WHOLE file into one JS string
before load — a real 300MB+ memory spike on exactly the large-model case the chooser exists for) with
`_ccExtractStoreyNamesFromIfcFileIncremental`, a chunked `File.slice()`+`TextDecoder` scan that stops
early once several chunks add nothing new and never reads past a 64MB ceiling. **Six clash-pipeline
cores graduated** (discipline/assignment/identity/reconciliation/classification/projectCodec): user
explicitly authorized removing the fallback safety net after being shown that "legacy" wasn't actually
dead code — every boot ran a live equivalence check deciding whether the new core was even active, and
was the real fallback path on any mismatch or opt-out. Deleted all six inline legacy implementations,
their boot-time comparison functions, and their manifest flags/opt-out tokens entirely — the six
`clash-*-core.js`/`project-codec.js` modules (already loaded as plain same-origin `<script defer>`,
not addons) are now the sole, unconditional implementation, called directly with no branching. A
missing module now throws a real `TypeError` instead of silently degrading — there is no fallback left,
by design. Test files that extracted the inline legacy code from `index.html` for characterization
(`discipline-classification.test.js` and others) now `require()` the standalone modules directly
instead; two fully-redundant ones (`assignment-rules-resolver.test.js`, `clash-reconcile.test.js`) were
deleted since `clash-assignment-core.test.js`/`clash-reconciliation-core.test.js` already cover the
same ground against the module. Verified: 601/601 unit tests, full real-Chromium smoke green with the
six `_ccClash*Core`/`_ccProjectCodec` modules confirmed loaded and zero leftover status/gate objects.

~~**REWRITE_UI_PLAN.md phases 2–12 executed and merged**
(PR #689, branch `claude/review-rewrite-ui-plan-tfasne`, 2026-07-17)~~ — windowed conflict list
(`ccUiWindowedConflicts`), truthful empty/filtered states (`ccUiEmptyStates`), `OperationCenter`
(`ccUiOperationCenter`), six clash-pipeline cores promoted to `defaultEnabled:true` (with real
opt-out support added to `safety-migrations.js`), IFC worker protocol versioning + differential
worker/fallback fingerprint harness, shared focus-trap hook applied to `ShortcutsModal`
(`ccUiModalV2`), true first-use lazy loading for `pointcloud.js`/`splat.js`, browser RSS
instrumentation in `perf-local.mjs`/`memory-local.mjs`, and a pre-decode storey-scope chooser
(`ccUiStoreyChooser`). 605/605 unit tests + full real-Chromium smoke green; a CodeQL
`js/path-injection` finding on the new differential-harness test server was fixed (containment
guard + loopback-only bind, matching sibling harnesses) before merge. **Not done: Phase 8's
toolbar retrofit** — a live `ResponsiveToolGroup` integration into the toolbar's CAMERA cluster
hit a real flexbox shrink/overflow bug (confirmed via `getBoundingClientRect`, genuine DOM overlap
with an adjacent button) that wasn't resolved in time, so the integration was reverted rather than
shipped broken. The component itself (`ResponsiveToolGroup`, its pure fitting algorithm, 9 passing
unit tests) is still in `index.html` as unintegrated infrastructure — pick this up as its own
follow-up rather than re-deriving it. `REWRITE_UI_PLAN.md` itself was deleted after this merge
(11/12 items done, content preserved in the PR #688/#689 history) — this paragraph is now the
only record of the outstanding toolbar item.

~~**External (GPT) rewrite package reviewed, adjusted, and merged + UI plan critically consolidated**
(branch `claude/review-rewrite-ui-plan-tfasne`, 2026-07-16)~~ — the user supplied a GPT-authored
"local rewrite candidate" ZIP (baseline `018c679`, exactly this HEAD) and a UI improvement plan.
Adopted after line-by-line diff review (~340-line index.html diff + cc-runtime.js + sw.js + tests):
explicit `cc-runtime.js` runtime module (registry / deduplicating script loader / load coordinator),
coordinator-based load lifecycle replacing the `_lazyWorkersActive`/`_chainEndFired` counter pair,
true on-demand loading for smart-bridge + openaec-bridge (placeholder defs in the Integrations panel,
`window._ccEnsureAddon(id)`, SW precache dropped + runtime-cached after first use), `defer` on the
nine migration-helper scripts, 500→120 ms completion dwell, per-mesh `_styleMats`/`_edges` disposal on
model unload/replace (verified per-mesh, NOT the shared #572 phong cache — that must never be disposed
per-mesh), centralized section-cut-line disposal (also fixes a rebuild-path geometry leak), extended
smoke (cancel / forced worker-fallback / lazy-addon load once) + `perf-local.mjs` / `memory-local.mjs`
probes. **Three real defects found in review and fixed before merge** (details in `REWRITE_UI_PLAN.md`):
(1) lazy activation silently skipped `def.onEnable` — the Integrations panel read the def synchronously,
so first-ever Smart Bridge Enable would never kick off the Connector download/connect; `_ccActivateAddon`'s
lazy branch now resolves with the real def and the panel fires `onEnable` after it settles (verified in
real Chromium end-to-end); (2) the `defer` switch made Chromium's preload scanner deterministically fetch
the literal URL `${vp.snapshot}` out of an htm template in the inline script (404 console noise; same bug
class as the earlier `sn.img` fix; baseline already fired it intermittently) — fixed all four
`<img src=${…}` htm sites with `\x3Cimg` (cooked string identical for the hand-written htm parser, which
consumes cooked statics — verified; raw bytes hide the tag from the scanner); (3) dead `loadDeferred`
wrapper removed + openaec placeholder description aligned with the real def. **Rule going forward:** any
core read of a lazily-loaded addon's state slice (`s.smartBridge`, `s.openaecBridge`) must stay
null-guarded — `initState` only merges after first activation now (all current reads audited, guarded).
Verified: 535/535 unit tests + FULL real-Chromium smoke green in this sandbox (offline CDN mirror via
`CC_BROWSER_OFFLINE_DEPS=1` + npm-pinned react/three/web-ifc etc. + `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium` —
this now works in the CCR sandbox, note for future sessions). GPT's benchmark read critically: the
headline −30% end-to-end is mostly the cosmetic dwell removal + WASM-first ordering; the −22.3% transfer
is real (unused smart-bridge/openaec bytes); heap +4.1% is non-forced-GC noise. The UI plan's core
diagnosis verified against code (VirtualList idle-reveals to FULL length — real 50k-row cost; ≤2000
grouping guard real; history constraints corroborated) and was adopted as roadmap with re-prioritization
(measurement harness → windowed list → empty-states/consent → operation feedback as coordinator consumer
→ toolbar/panels/mobile → modal/a11y). Full consolidated 12-step plan in `REWRITE_UI_PLAN.md`.

~~**Guarded core-refactor patch train ported to main** (branch `claude/cc-repo-code-review-gk4421`, 2026-07-15)~~ —
six externally-authored patches (Codex) extracting discipline / assignment / identity / reconciliation /
classification / project-codec logic into standalone modules behind default-off `ccSafety` flags with boot-time
legacy-equivalence gates, extending the #683 containment pattern. Ported (not applied verbatim — base commit
`1a5dcae` never existed here): sw.js keeps its version-derived CACHE name (CI bump rotates it; the original
`-refactorN` suffix would have been wiped by `bump-version.sh`), cache-name test assertions are version-agnostic,
the redundant smoke dialog handler was dropped (main fixed it in `1e187a1`), and **the classification module was
re-extracted from main's spatial-hash `classifyClashes`** — the original patch carried the pre-optimization O(n²)
scan, which the value-equality gate would have silently activated. All six flags default off; opted-in validation
runs once at boot and falls back to the inline legacy code on any mismatch. Verified: 521/521 unit tests + full
Chromium smoke (all ten `ccSafety` opt-ins, IFC/WASM load, detection, hard-refresh restore, scoped load,
BatchedMesh, zero console errors). Bonus fix the new strict smoke gate exposed: Chromium's preload scanner was
fetching the literal URL `'+sn.img+'` from the report-builder string on every page load (`'<im'+'g'` split).
Smoke now supports `CC_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE` + `CC_BROWSER_OFFLINE_DEPS=1` (context-level routing so the service
worker's fetches hit the mirror too) for restricted runners.

Post-merge follow-up (branch `claude/task-pending-55wmp1`, restarted from main after #681 merged, 2026-07-14) —  **[STALE?]**
the three open points from the stress-test report, now done:

- **Exhaustive tool-combination sweep** — drove 40 tool combos + weird combinations (section/walk/2D/measure/
  markup/projection/render-style/panel/tab thrash) and the key behavioural flows (BCF export **and** import
  roundtrip 0→187 issues, confirm→issue, federation, model reload/REPLACE, isolate). **Zero crashes, zero real
  bugs** — the app is robust across the surface driven. (BCF import needs the `{base64}` signature, not a File —
  `_ccImportBCF(File)` silently falls through to the interactive picker; that tripped my first test, not a bug.)
- **Detection performance wall, FIXED (the big one)** — profiled: the clash MATH is fast (~1.4s/15k clashes);
  the wall was `classifyClashes`' cluster-grouping — an all-pairs O(clashes²) scan (~2.2 BILLION iterations at
  47k clashes = most of the 167s). Replaced with a spatial hash (bucket by type-pair|storey|500mm cell, seed
  compares own+26 neighbour cells). Behaviour-identical (verified vs an in-browser O(n²) reference on a dense
  fixture: 3 clusters sizes 6/4/2, exact match). **mega 167s→21.6s (7.7×), huge 15.7s→6.7s.** Next linear
  target (not done, low-risk future work): core `merge_and_post` is now 73% of mega (~15s) but LINEAR
  (~0.08ms/candidate) — per-candidate clash-object construction; cache per-element material/discipline to shave it.
- **Mobile — assessed good, small fix** — the ≤768px UI is purpose-built and solid: full-width mobile panels
  (Navigator/Issues/Conflicts/Models), bottom `.cc-mobile-nav` with badges, command palette (Search) exposing
  ALL viewer tools (section/measure/walk/2D/wireframe), and my declutter fix keeps the mobile clash card compact.
  No rebuild needed. Found + fixed one real bug surfaced here: the command palette showed **"Render: undefined"**
  because `renderStyles` includes `'xray'` but `renderLabels` lacked it → added `xray:'X-Ray'`.

Synthetic fixtures live in scratchpad/serve/fixtures (medium ~230 / large ~2.8k / huge ~10k / mega ~41k products,
plus dense.ifc for cluster testing). All 54 tests/*.test.js pass throughout.

On branch `claude/task-pending-55wmp1` (2026-07-14) — sandboxed stress-testing of the live app  **[STALE?]**
(headless Chromium + Playwright, synthetic IFC fixtures up to ~41k products) surfaced and fixed
three genuine, root-caused, regression-tested bugs:

- **Clash-review crash (React #310), FIXED** — clicking any clash card in the Conflicts panel crashed the
  whole app to the "Something went wrong" boundary. Root cause: an `${isClash && function(){ …useState… }()}`
  conditional IIFE inside `IssueRow`'s render — the hook count changed when a row expanded, violating the
  Rules of Hooks. Extracted into a proper `ClashToleranceEditor` component. This broke the *entire* clash
  triage workflow. Verified: clearance field + "update standard?" prompt + collapse/re-expand + switching
  clashes, zero hook errors. `IssueRow` now has only 3 unconditional top-level hooks (whole bug class cleared).
- **Stuck loading modal on worker fallback, FIXED** — every `loadIFCWorker` rejection path (Worker-ctor throw,
  20s watchdog, worker `error`) rejects *without* calling `onProps`, so the sync `loadIFC` fallback never
  released `_lazyWorkersActive` → the "Placing elements 85%" modal stuck forever (Cancel didn't help) even
  though the model loaded fine. Most likely on big files that trip the watchdog. Fixed with an idempotent
  `_releaseLazyGate()` called from both the `onProps` success path and the fallback's `.finally`. Verified by
  forcing `new Worker` to throw → model loads via fallback → modal clears.
- **Rotation-centre inconsistent across selection paths, FIXED** — a 3D-canvas click recentred the orbit pivot
  on the clicked element, but selecting the same element from the model tree / search / list / public
  `highlight()` API did **not** (pivot stayed ~19 m away). Extracted the canvas pick's pivot math into a shared
  `_shiftPivotTo` / `_shiftPivotToElement`, and moved the shift into `_highlightById` (the shared selection
  primitive) with a `keepPivot` opt-out for right-click. Now every selection path recentres the pivot (verified
  0.00 m on all paths; was 19.23 m for tree/API). Matches the user's expectation "selected element = centre of rotation".

Follow-up wave (same branch, 2026-07-14) — the "still open" items above, now built + verified:  **[STALE?]**

- **Federation same-discipline 0-clash trap, FIXED** — two same-discipline models federated returned 0 clashes
  in 0.2s with no explanation (`excludeSameDiscipline` default skips every cross-model pair). Now a toast on
  completion names the shared discipline(s), plus a persistent actionable banner in the empty Conflicts panel
  with a one-click "Check same-discipline pairs & re-run" button (dispatches `UPD_RULES {excludeSameDiscipline:false}`
  + `_ccRunDetection`). Verified 0 → 612 cross-model clashes.
- **Wheel-zoom fly-to-void, FIXED** — zoom-to-cursor / empty-space drive-forward advanced the orbit target
  every notch unbounded, so ~20 notches flew the camera into blank space. Added `_clampZoomTarget` (target
  kept within model AABB + half-size margin) on all three target-advancing branches. NB: `makeOrbit` is a
  top-level helper — it cannot see the App component's `modelsRef`/`_elemsBBox` (that threw and *broke* zoom
  in the first attempt); reach bounds via `window._ccViewport.getBounds()` instead, cached by model signature
  so it's not O(n)/notch. Verified: dollies in, extreme zoom floors at sph.r 0.5 (not ∞), no pageerror.
- **Clash card over-dense, FIXED** — the AI-training-feedback block (Verdict + Clash type + 11-chip Reason
  grid + Resolution + Note) was the bulk of the expanded card. Wrapped in a native `<details>`/`<summary>`
  ("Train the AI — optional"), collapsed by default. Native disclosure = zero React state, so it CANNOT
  reintroduce a conditional hook (that render IIFE calls no hooks — keep it that way).
- **Phone layout, FIXED (3 targeted, low-risk changes)** — (a) `/tour/` + `/best-free-ifc-viewer/` sticky
  headers had no `@media`; nav wrapped 2–3 rows over the logo (~112px). Added max-width:600px rules that drop
  the nav under the brand (~80px, no overlap). (b) The main-app "Open a model" welcome card was left-inset
  (`min(8vw,6rem)`) with a 2-col grid + 2.6rem h1 — off-centre + cramped on phones. Added a max-width:640px
  rule (scoped to new `.cc-welcome-card`/`.cc-welcome-illus`) → full-width single-column, illustration hidden,
  smaller headline. Desktop unchanged. NB: on ≤768px the desktop `.cc-ai-panel` is already `display:none` and
  a purpose-built mobile UI (`.cc-mobile-nav` bottom tabs, `.cc-mobile-theme`) takes over — the viewer-with-model
  mobile experience is already good; don't rip it out.

All 54 `tests/*.test.js` pass after every change. PR #681 carries all of the above (6 commits). Reverted the
compare-page "make ClashControl win the 3 verdicts" copy edit — per the owner, those category wins should be
earned by the product, not spun in marketing copy.

On branch `codex/phase0-trust-hardening` (2026-07-14) — narrowly scoped trust and  **[STALE?]**
release hardening requested after a codebase review. No geometry, IFC-loader,
renderer, clash-engine, BCF, or Revit-protocol changes are in scope.

- ~~Telemetry/training sharing now requires an explicit choice; analytics uses the
  same gate on the app and secondary pages, legacy opt-outs stay denied, and old
  auto-seeded grants are re-prompted.~~ (2026-07-14)
- ~~`/api/training` now caps request/batch/field/nested JSON sizes, validates known
  record types, clamps numbers, and repeats path/email minimisation server-side.~~
  (2026-07-14)  **[STALE?]**
- ~~Smart Bridge now implements cached `GET /update`, safely degrades if GitHub is
  unavailable, and links to a manual checksum-published release. Unsigned automatic
  binary replacement was removed; `POST /update` returns manual guidance.~~ (2026-07-14)
- ~~SSPL is consistently described as source-available. Loam is documented and kept
  external; `ingest_detection_feedback` is its narrow adapter over the general
  Smart Bridge/connective-spine boundary.~~ (2026-07-14)
- ~~Release/doc drift fixed: real 66-tool count is regression-checked, docs-only
  pushes no longer bump the app, issue links use the canonical repo, and the full
  Node suite passes (386/386) plus all standalone JS syntax checks.~~ (2026-07-14)

Follow-up (2026-07-14, this branch) — rebased the above trust-hardening series onto  **[STALE?]**
main post-#682 and merged the four default-off safety migrations (`concurrencyV2`,
`geoCacheV8`, `batchedSectionsV2`, `rendererV2`; see `safety-migrations.js`) plus the
incident-regression test pack. Full suite green after rebase. See PR #683.

On branch `claude/clashcontrol-competitive-analysis-gra92c` (2026-07-13) — competitive analysis vs  **[STALE?]**
Solibri/Navisworks/OSS (IfcOpenShell, ThatOpen, xeokit, Speckle, BIMcollab, Revizto, buildingSMART IDS)
+ Wave-0 correctness fixes:

- **`IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` added** — full analysis + 6-wave roadmap. Thesis (evidence-backed): CC already
  has the pro FEATURE set (cross-run clash reconciliation `computeClashIdentityKey`/`mergeDetectionResults`
  is comparable-or-better than Navisworks' GUID matching, clustering, BCF 2.1/3.0, workspace-aware
  inspector, ahead-of-bar measurement snapping) — the gap vs competitors is **honesty** (fake penetration
  depth, phantom `minGap`, exact-engine silently dropping rules, hollow BCF viewpoints, quality score
  skipping checks shown in its own panel), **noise** (no default clash matrix/tolerance floor → 10k-clash
  first runs), and **feel** (dead orbit-pivot bug, AO/edges built-but-disabled). Waves 1-6 (triage funnel,
  review loop/camera feel, BCF fidelity, search sets, IDS conformance, scale) are roadmap, not yet built.
- ~~**Wave 0 correctness fixes, 9 items, each its own commit + test where the fix is pure logic**~~ (2026-07-13):
  - ~~Orbit pivot recenters to selection~~ — `sph.setFromVector3` on a plain `{r,phi,theta}` object silently
    threw and was swallowed; camera always orbited the pre-selection target. `ab5e5a2`.
  - ~~Model visibility toggle no longer needs a camera nudge~~ — the manual per-mesh culling pass
    (`updateCulling`) throttles to 1-per-8 rendered frames; a bare `invalidate()` (2 frames) wasn't enough
    to cross that gate, so re-shown models stayed individually `.visible=false` until orbiting kept
    invalidating long enough. New `S._forceCull` bypasses the throttle once per models-list change.
    `204a039`. (Found live mid-session from a user bug report, not the original research pass.)
  - ~~`minGap` actually applies~~ — collected/displayed everywhere but never checked; `isSoft` only tested
    the upper bound. Now `[minGap, maxGap]`. `623727a`.
  - ~~Local-engine rule parity~~ — `_serializeForLocalEngine` sent only modelA/B+maxGap+a `mode` field the
    browser's rules object never sets (always fell through to `'hard'` — a configured soft-only run
    silently ran hard-only on the exact engine). Now sends the full scalar rule set + pre-filters
    `IfcSpace` client-side; semantic-filter (`relatedPairs`) parity explicitly deferred (needs a payload
    shape change). Engine-repo companion change (apply the new fields in `engine.py`/`sweep.py`) documented
    in `IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`, not yet done in that repo. `739af54`.
  - ~~Assignee/priority survive re-runs~~ — `mergeDetectionResults`' persisting-clash branch carried status/AI
    fields/linkedIssueId forward but not `assignee`/`priority`. `ff02b09`.
  - ~~JS/WASM hit-point parity~~ — JS validated candidate points against both elements' AABBs±10mm before
    accepting a hit; the WASM path returned its raw point unvalidated, so results (and even hit/miss)
    could differ depending on whether WASM loaded. Extracted `_pointInBothBoxes`, gated both paths on it.
    `e020f1a`.
  - ~~Quality Score includes BIM-basics~~ — `computeQualityScore` only ever folded in
    `runDataQualityChecks`+accessibility. `runBIMModelChecks` now always folds in (generic, region-neutral).
    `runILSChecks` (Dutch NL-BIM Basis ILS v2) is nuanced: `noNLSfB` has no IfcType gating, so an
    unadopted-NL-SfB project would score near-zero on a standard it never uses — ILS now always shows as
    its own breakdown category but only counts toward the headline number once the project shows real
    adoption (≥20% of elements carry a code). IDS deliberately not touched (different result shape,
    belongs with Wave 5). `fcad866`.
  - ~~Render key 5 = wireframe~~ (was a duplicate of xray; wireframe had no key) + ~~walk-mode postFX fixed~~
    (`_walkEnter` turned SAO/Outline/SMAA on synchronously but only when the pre-walk style wasn't already
    `'rendered'`, and even then the `renderStyle:'rendered'` dispatch's own re-render immediately re-ran the
    normal-mode "disable postFX, it blurs" effect right after — walk mode never actually got it). `55ca009`.
  - ~~Stable discipline colors~~ — `byDiscipline` color-by assigned colors by element-count rank
    (`CLASS_COLORS[idx]`), not by what the discipline IS — structural could be blue in one federation, red
    in another, never matching the app's own `DISC` semantic map used elsewhere. New `DISC_COLOR_BY_ID`
    lookup used by both the 3D scene and the Navigator panel dots; other views (byType/byStorey/byMaterial)
    unchanged. `fe33b2e`.
  - Doc drift fixed: MEMORY.md's Project State + Architecture Decisions both claimed the Python local
    engine does "true solid boolean ops" — verified false by reading `ClashControlEngine/src/
    clashcontrol_engine/intersection.py` directly; it runs the identical Möller tri-tri + BVH algorithm as
    the browser, just faster (Numba JIT + multiprocess + scipy KD-tree). Corrected both rows.
  - Verification: `npm test` (83/83 passing, up from 68 — 4 new test files, each extracting real
    production code out of `index.html`/addons the same way `tests/ifc-units.test.js` does, not
    reimplementing the logic under test), main-script parse via `new Function` after every edit. NOT
    browser-verified (Playwright/CDN blocked in this sandbox per prior sessions) — the detection-engine
    changes (`minGap`, WASM/JS parity) and the culling-throttle fix in particular need a real browser
    pass; flagged in each commit message.
- 3 sibling repos cloned into the session for reference (`ClashControlEngine`, `ClashControlConnector`,
  `ClashControlSmartBridge` — the last is confirmed superseded, see its own README banner). Engine's
  `intersection.py`/`sweep.py` read directly to ground CW-1 (real penetration depth + `manifold3d`
  intersection volume — Wave 1, not started) and the local-engine parity fix above.
- PR #679 opened (draft), `subscribe_pr_activity` on. User then said "go full throttle to the end" (execute
  Waves 1-6 autonomously, no further check-ins) and "pile it into one PR, or multiple only if they get big"
  (stay on #679 unless a piece of work is large enough to need its own — `ClashControlEngine` is the one
  structural exception, separate repo). Continuing on the same branch/PR:
- ~~**Wave 1.1-1.3: the default clash matrix (the triage funnel's first, highest-leverage lever)**~~
  (2026-07-13):  **[STALE?]**
  - Per-element discipline classification: `_DISC_TYPE_MAP` (flat IfcType→discipline, extracted from
    `detectDiscipline`'s inline tables, behavior-preserving) + `_ccElementDiscipline(el, modelDiscipline)`
    (discriminating type wins, else falls back to the model's own vote) — closes the per-model-granularity
    gap a combined STR+MEP IFC file had (one label for the whole model). `22bdb80`.
  - Default matrix: `rules.excludeSameDiscipline` (default true) + `rules.disciplineMatrix` (sparse
    `"discA:discB"` override map) + `_ccMatrixSkipsSameDiscipline(...)` wired into both the chunk
    pre-filter and `_processCandidate`'s authoritative check. `1aac245`.
  - Matrix UI: 5×5 triangular grid in `ClashRulesPanel` advanced section, click-to-toggle any cell.
    `6ef0e6c`.
  - **CRITICAL FIX same day, caught by `browser-smoke` CI, not by me**: the default matrix skipped
    same-*discipline* pairs, but the smoke fixture is two crossing walls in ONE model — both fall back to
    that model's single discipline, so they read as "same discipline" and got skipped, reporting 0 clashes
    on a real physical overlap. Same-discipline is a *cross-model* federation-noise concept; a same-model
    self-clash is a data-integrity error and must never be suppressed by it. Added a `sameModel` param to
    `_ccMatrixSkipsSameDiscipline`, checked *before* any discipline/matrix logic, always wins. `e7c4100`.
  - 17 tests in `tests/discipline-classification.test.js` (incl. the `sameModel` regression) + 3 in
    `tests/discipline-colors.test.js`.
- ~~**Wave 1.4: real (approximate) penetration depth — CW-1a**~~ (2026-07-13). The user's explicit
  directive from earlier in the session ("escalating to \[the local engine\] gets you speed, not
  fundamentally more correct geometry") committed this as its own workstream. What hard clashes reported as
  "depth" was `_triTriTest`'s 4th return value — the SAT overlap-interval length of *one* colliding triangle
  pair along their cross-normal axis, maxed across all colliding pairs. Real number, not penetration depth:
  long for a shallow graze between two big triangles, shrinks on fine tessellation regardless of true
  overlap. New `_estimatePenetrationDepthM(elA, elB)`: for each mesh's vertices that ray-parity-test as
  *inside* the other mesh (3-axis majority vote against its BVH), find the true closest-point-on-surface
  distance (Ericson's algorithm, not nearest-*vertex*) to the other mesh; max across both sides ≈ true
  penetration (MTD-style approximation). Runs only on confirmed hard-clash pairs (post tri-tri), never the
  broad-phase set. Null (open/non-manifold mesh, or a graze where no vertex of either side is actually
  inside — e.g. a thin post clean through a slab with both meshes' corners outside each other, a real
  documented limitation) falls through to the old chord-length estimate, then the AABB-overlap estimate —
  same fallback shape as before, just with a genuinely better first tier.
  **Caught a real bug pre-commit**: casting the parity rays exactly axis-aligned is the worst possible
  choice for *this* codebase specifically (IFC geometry is overwhelmingly axis-aligned) — a ray from the
  exact center of a symmetric test cube landed precisely on a shared triangle edge on all 3 axes at once,
  and the ray-triangle test's inclusive edge tolerance double-counted that one crossing (once per triangle
  sharing the edge), flipping odd parity to even — reporting the center of a unit cube as *outside* it, and
  no majority vote could catch it since all 3 axes failed identically. Fixed by casting along small fixed
  off-axis tilts instead of pure axes (also lets the BVH node-prune use a standard generic slab test, since
  no direction component is ever exactly 0 anymore). `e8425ea`. 16 analytic-solid tests in
  `tests/penetration-depth.test.js` (offset cubes, a post partially into a slab, the full-through-slab null
  case, disjoint cubes, a symmetric fully-contained cube) — verified against hand-computed expected depths,
  not just "doesn't throw."
  **Not yet done: the Python-engine companion (CW-1b, same technique + `manifold3d` exact-volume tier) — a
  separate repo (`ClashControlEngine`), needs its own PR per the branch-scoping rule.**
- ~~**Wave 2.1, 2.3, 2.5, 2.6 — camera/review-loop feel**~~ (2026-07-13):
  - Zoom-out now honors the cursor too (mirrors the existing zoom-in-to-cursor branch: retreat the target
    away from the picked point and grow `sph.r`, instead of the old pure `sph.r *= zoomFactor` around
    whatever the orbit target happened to be). `bd37b37`.
  - Shift+left-drag = pan fallback (was middle-mouse-button only — no trackpad path at all). Checked for
    key collisions first: Ctrl/Cmd is multi-select on click, Shift is unclaimed on the orbit canvas's own
    mousedown handler. Added a "Mouse" section to the shortcuts modal (orbit/pan/zoom had zero in-app
    documentation before this). `49a7bc8`.
  - Double-click-to-frame turned out to already exist (`index.html` ~7996, predates this session) — no
    work needed, closes that Wave 2.3 item. Present-mode click-to-frame ("present is inert") turned out to
    already be *intentionally* disabled with a clear rationale ("read-only walkthrough; framing fights the
    user") — the Wave-0 orbit-pivot fix (unconditional, runs before the fly-gate) already made present-mode
    clicks meaningful again (recenters the pivot for subsequent drags), so no further change — overriding a
    deliberate, commented design decision based on stale pre-Wave-0 research would have been wrong.
  - On-canvas color legend (`ColorLegend`, bottom-left of the viewport) for `colorByClass` views — swatch/
    label/count next to the model instead of only in the side-panel Navigator list (BIMcollab Smart-View
    parity). Sort + color-index logic copied verbatim from the 3D scene tint effect so it can't drift.
    `bbc5717`.
  - Distinct A/B clash-pair colors: `_itemRefs` already tagged each ref `role:'A'`/`'B'`, but
    `_highlightRefs` only ever colored by model discipline — so same-discipline pairs (incl. every
    same-model self-clash) highlighted both sides identically. `_highlightRefs` now checks `ref.role` first,
    fixed red/cyan for A/B, falling back to discipline color for every other caller (verified `_itemRefs` is
    the only producer of role A/B anywhere in the file). `77bd6f8`.
  - Keyboard status hotkeys (C/D/V = confirm/deny/accept-check) reuse the exact
    `_ccPrepareAdvance`→`UPD_CLASH`→`_ccAdvanceToNext` sequence the existing mouse-only buttons already used
    — J/K → C/D/V is now a full keyboard-only triage loop. Added a "Clash triage" shortcuts section (J/K/
    Tab/T/R/X/'/' had none either). `46eb1c9`. Together, tween-frame + isolate/ghost(~12%) + J/K all already
    existed; A/B color + status hotkeys were the two actually-missing pieces of "Wave 2.1: clash focus
    state."
  - Wave 2.2 (occluder-reveal toggle) and 2.4 (edges/SSAO in normal viewing) intentionally deferred —
    ghosting already gets most of 2.2's value now that it exists, and 2.4 is explicitly the highest-risk
    remaining item per this file's own history-informed guardrails (renderer/tone-mapping touchiness).
- ~~**Wave 1.6: deterministic severity model**~~ (2026-07-13). `aiSeverity` (critical/major/minor/info)
  already drove sort/group-by/cluster-dot/row-dot, but it's only ever set by opt-in AI actions — every one
  of those sites fell back to a flat per-*type* guess when absent (every hard clash the same critical-red
  dot, tied for the same sort rank, no matter the actual depth or discipline). New
  `_ccDeterministicSeverity(c)` uses the real depth from CW-1a + per-element disciplines (max of the pair,
  not an average) to produce a real critical/major/minor/info verdict for every clash; every site above now
  reads `c.aiSeverity || _ccDeterministicSeverity(c)`. Tracing every fallback site to wire this in
  consistently turned up **3 independent, real, pre-existing vocabulary bugs**, all fixed in the same
  commit: the AI triage prompt asked for `critical|high|medium|low` against display code that only
  recognizes `critical|major|minor|info` (so a compliant AI response would render with no color); a
  cluster-summary table's own rank map used the same wrong vocabulary (major/minor always fell through to
  rank 0); and `severity_asc`/`_desc`'s `o[a.aiSeverity]||2` silently mistreated every *critical* clash as
  rank 2 (tied with minor) because `'critical'` ranks `0`, which `||` reads as falsy. `551011e`. Also:
  `disciplines:[mA.discipline,mB.discipline]` (whole-model, stale even after Wave 1.1) →
  `_ccElementDiscipline`-based (per-element) — the same upgrade the clash matrix got, this separate
  display/severity field had never received it. `e22301a`. 13 tests in `tests/severity-model.test.js`.
  **Found but deliberately deferred**: `rules.excludeSelf` defaults to `true` app-wide (confirmed
  consistent across `INIT.rules`, every preset, and the NL-command layer — not an oversight, a real design
  choice), meaning a project that's a single combined IFC file finds **zero** clashes on the very first,
  most prominent "Run detection" click, with no visible explanation why. Touches dozens of call sites
  (NL parsing, presets, `_captureDetectionSettings`) — needs its own focused pass, not a bolt-on.
- ~~**Wave 1.9: one-click run — verified already substantially satisfied, no changes needed**~~ (2026-07-13).
  Checked `RunDetectionModal`/`ClashRulesPanel` against the plan item ("auto-matrix + defaults + funnel;
  existing panel becomes Advanced") before building anything new: the modal already leads with 6 one-click
  preset buttons + a single prominent "Run detection" footer button that runs with whatever `s.rules`
  currently is, and both the matrix/tolerance editor and "Project standards" are already collapsed behind
  an Advanced toggle by default. Wave 1.2's new default clash matrix means even the bare "Run detection"
  button (zero configuration) now runs with sane discipline filtering out of the box. The `excludeSelf`
  single-model gap above is the one real first-run trap left, and it's already logged separately.
- ~~**Wave 1.7: show the detection funnel**~~ (2026-07-13). The default clash matrix (Wave 1.2) already
  filters same-discipline noise on every run, but nothing surfaced that it had happened outside the
  developer-only diagnostics panel. New `matrix_skipped` counter on the existing detection-profile object
  (one counter, one increment site — the WASM chunk-warmup pre-filter re-tests the same matrix check as a
  cache-population shortcut but every candidate still reaches the authoritative check in
  `_processCandidate`, so counting only there avoids double-counting), shown as a new diagnostics-panel
  row. More importantly: new `_showFunnelToast()` shows a one-line "N pairs checked → M filtered by
  discipline matrix → K clashes found" toast to *every* user after *every* browser-engine run, no
  diagnostics flag needed — hooked into `_browserDetect`'s own promise chain (the one function all 9
  `detectClashesAsync` call sites funnel through) rather than touching each site, and only reads
  `window._ccDetectProfile` right after that run set it so it can't show a stale number or leak in when
  the local engine (which doesn't populate that global) handled the run. `f63743b` (PR #680 — #679 merged
  mid-session, branch restarted from the new `main`, see below). 6 tests.
  Wave 1.8 (spatial sub-clustering) and the `excludeSelf` single-model default trap remain deferred — same
  reasoning as before (1.8 needs its own careful opt-in design, not a change to default grouping behavior;
  `excludeSelf` touches dozens of call sites).
- **PR #679 merged to `main` by explicit user instruction** ("merge to main. Continue with the to do's")
  mid-session — squash-free `merge` method to preserve the granular one-fix-per-commit history. Per the
  branch-restart convention, the designated branch was reset to the new `main` and PR #680 opened for
  continued work — its diff is scoped to genuinely new commits (confirmed via `merge-base --is-ancestor`
  before any push) rather than re-showing everything from #679. **Note for future sessions**: a
  `force-with-lease` push during that reset was correctly blocked by the auto-mode classifier (the user's
  merge instruction didn't name that specific destructive op) — the clean fix was cherry-picking the one
  new commit onto the *old* (pre-reset) branch tip instead of onto the new `main`, since the old tip is now
  an ancestor of `main` (regular merge, not squash) and a plain fast-forward push needs no force at all.
- ~~**Wave 3.1: BCF viewpoints write `<Components><Selection>`**~~ (2026-07-13). The single biggest audited
  interop gap: CC's BCF *exporter* wrote only `<PerspectiveCamera>` — no `<Components>` — so a CC-exported
  BCF had no selectable elements in Solibri/BIMcollab/Navisworks, or even CC's own *importer*, which
  already parses `<Component IfcGuid=...>` out of viewpoint files on the way in and has for a while. Every
  exported topic now carries `<Components><Selection>` populated from the item's own identity data
  (`globalIds`/`globalIdA`/`globalIdB`, deduped) — no new capture-side work needed, this data already
  existed on every clash/issue. Placed before the camera element per the BCF schema's element order.
  `34dc868`. 4 new tests in `tests/bcf-export.test.js` (element order, dedup, the no-identity-data case,
  round-trip shape against CC's own importer).
  **Deliberately narrow scope, two related gaps left for follow-up**: (1) issues with no linked, user-saved
  viewpoint still get **no `.bcfv` file at all** — probably the common case for a quick "export these
  clashes" action, since most users don't manually save+link a viewpoint per clash first. Fixing that means
  synthesizing a reasonable default camera position from just a clash `point`, which needs its own careful
  design (existing "frame a point" conventions live deep in the live-render closures, e.g. `_fitToClashes`/
  `_zoomDist`, not yet checked for safe reuse at export time) rather than inventing new framing math under
  time pressure — camera math is exactly the kind of thing this file already warns about getting wrong
  without visual verification. (2) `<ClippingPlanes>` — CC already captures section-plane state on every
  viewpoint (`vp.section`) but never exports it; the existing section-to-world-space conversion math (used
  for live rendering, e.g. around `new THREE.Plane(...)` call sites in the section/section-box effects) is
  deeply coupled to live scene state and wasn't yet confirmed safe to reuse at export time in one sitting.
- ~~**Wave 1.8: spatial sub-clustering**~~ (2026-07-13). The existing `'cluster'` groupBy
  (`_ccClusterKeyFor`) groups touch points between the *same two elements* — a duct crossing one beam at 3
  points along its run correctly collapses to one group, but a duct crossing 5 *different* joists in the
  same corridor bay showed as 5 separate-looking groups, even though it reads as one problem area. New
  `_ccSpatialClusterMap(items, radiusM)`: distance-threshold union-find on clash points (1.5m default),
  grid-bucketed (same spirit as the engine's `_SpatialHash`) for O(n) average. Wired in as a new `'nearby'`
  groupBy dimension ("Location" in the secondary group-by dropdown) — deliberately additive, doesn't touch
  the default "Grouped" (cluster) view. `4ab0bba`. 8 tests (radius boundary, transitive chaining through a
  bridging point — why this needs real union-find not a naive pairwise pass —, unlocated items, label
  stability, grid-bucket neighbor search across a cell boundary).
  **Wave 1 (the triage funnel) is now fully shipped except 1.5** (the Python `manifold3d` exact-volume
  tier — separate repo, hasn't been added to this session's write scope).
- **User redirected priorities mid-session**: asked for a plan on 4 external OpenAEC-ecosystem repos
  (`jochem25/OpenAEC-BIM-validator`, `OpenAEC-Foundation/openaec-reports`, `-bcf-platform`,
  `-monty-ifc-viewer`). Researched via WebFetch (note: GitHub `/tree/<branch>/<path>` sub-paths 404 through
  this session's WebFetch — only repo-root pages and `raw.githubusercontent.com` file content work; also
  cost time discovering `OpenAEC-BIM-validator`'s default branch is `master`, not `main`). Proposed
  build/check/defer/skip; user said **"Build 1 and 3, check number 2"** — RVB BIM Norm port (build), PDF
  reports (build, overriding my own suggestion to defer it), BCF-platform cross-check (investigate only).
- ~~**Build 1: RVB BIM Norm v1.1 port**~~ (2026-07-13). Read `OpenAEC-BIM-validator`'s two public-standard
  `.ids` files directly (`RVB_BIM_Norm_v1.1.ids` 27 specs, `NL_BIM_Basis_ILS_v2.ids` 12 specs, both on
  `master`) — clean-room reimplementation against the standards' requirements, same policy as the existing
  `runILSChecks` comment states (no code copied from the validator). Mapped every RVB spec against CC's
  existing `runILSChecks`/`runBIMModelChecks` coverage first — most of NL-BIM Basis ILS v2 was ALREADY
  covered, often more thoroughly than the reference; work narrowed to the genuine gaps:
  - **Bug found + fixed first**: 7 of `runILSChecks`' 16 buckets (the "NL-BIM Basis ILS v2 additions" —
    storeyNaming, doorNaming, spaceIncomplete, fireRatingInvalid, extWallNoUValue,
    loadBearingInvalidMaterial, mepNoRenovationStatus) were computed every run but never appeared in the DQ
    panel's row list, CSV export, or "Create all issues" action — real findings silently invisible. New
    shared `ILS_KEYS` constant used everywhere the panel touches `ils`. `939693e`.
  - `IfcFurnishingElement` was already checked for NL-SfB presence but missing from `IFC_TO_NLSFB`, so a
    furnishing element miscoded with another discipline's group silently passed the mismatch check. Mapped
    to group 90 (Vaste inrichting), per RVB 2.2.7.11. `41b043a`.
  - `spaceIncomplete` extended: ObjectType, IsExternal (Pset_SpaceCommon), GrossFloorArea/Height
    (Qto_SpaceBaseQuantities) — RVB 2.2.7.6a/6b, alongside the pre-existing Name/LongName/NetFloorArea. A
    space could pass every old check while missing all four new ones. `a43956e`.
  - New IFC loader groundwork (purely additive, no existing field's shape/value changed): `IFCZONE`
    constant (`1033361043`, cross-verified against `ThatOpen/engine_web-ifc`'s `ifc-schema.ts` since 3 of
    the file's other hardcoded numeric IDs matched exactly); `extractSpatialHierarchy` now reads IfcZone
    (RVB 2.2.7.7) and stamps `_hasName` on project/site/building/zone (so a `safeStr(...)||'IfcProject'`
    fallback name can't be mistaken for a real one); `extractStoreys` stamps `hasElevation` (an explicit
    0.0 ground-floor elevation is otherwise indistinguishable from Elevation never being set). `7ee8167`.
  - New `runRVBChecks(models)` engine (addons/data-quality.js) — takes models directly, not a flat elements
    array, since spatialHierarchy/storeyData are per-model: IfcProject Name (2.2.7.1), IfcSite
    Name+georef (2.2.7.2), IfcBuilding Name (2.2.7.3), IfcZone Name/ObjectType for zones that exist
    (2.2.7.7, a model with none is not flagged — IfcZone is optional in IFC), IfcBuildingStorey Elevation
    (2.2.7.4). `f691141`.
  - Wired into `computeQualityScore` via a new `_foldEntityCheckMap` (each bucket carries its OWN `total` —
    project/site/building/zone/storey aren't the same population, so a shared `_total` like
    `_foldCheckMap` uses would misstate every bucket's failure ratio) and into the DQ panel as a new RVB
    section. **Deliberately never folds into the headline score or the panel's top "N issues" badge** — RVB
    is one Dutch central-government client's own norm, narrower even than the already-adoption-gated NL-SfB
    category; "missing IfcSite georeference" shouldn't tank the score of a model never meant to be
    geo-referenced. Reuses the existing `renderCheckGroup` (its "Highlight in 3D" button is a harmless
    no-op for these rows — project/site/building/zone entities aren't matched by GlobalId the way elements
    are — but "+issue" works correctly). `a79f434`.
  - 35 new tests across 6 files (`ils-panel-visibility`, `ils-furnishing`, `ils-space-quantities`,
    `spatial-hierarchy-rvb`, `rvb-checks`, `quality-score-rvb`, `rvb-panel-wiring`); `extractSpatialHierarchy`/
    `extractStoreys` tested via a minimal fake web-ifc `api` (same style as `bcf-export.test.js`'s fake
    JSZip). 194/194 passing.
  - **Not done**: `exportIDS()` (CC's own hardcoded-specs → .ids XML exporter) doesn't yet emit the new RVB
    checks as exportable IDS specs — the check ENGINE is done, the export-as-IDS representation is a
    separate, smaller follow-up if wanted.
- ~~**Check 2: cross-checked CC's BCF handling against `openaec-bcf-platform`'s Rust implementation**~~
  (2026-07-13). Unblocked the prior sub-path fetch failure by fetching `Cargo.toml` first (revealed the  **[STALE?]**
  `crates/bcf-core` + `crates/bcf-server` workspace layout) then `crates/bcf-core/src/{lib,visinfo,
  xml_types}.rs` directly via `raw.githubusercontent.com` — general lesson: when a repo root page works but
  `/tree/<branch>/<path>` 404s, fetch a known-likely file path directly instead of trying to browse.
  Findings: (1) **Components/Selection** — `XmlComponents.selection → XmlSelection.components: Vec<Xml
  Component>` with `#[serde(rename="Component")]`/`IfcGuid`-shaped, structurally identical to CC's own
  exporter/importer convention — confirms round-trip interop, no action needed. (2) **Coloring** — the
  platform DOES model `<Coloring><Color Color="#hex"><Component IfcGuid=.../></Color></Coloring>`; CC
  exports no `<Coloring>` at all (confirmed absent, not just theorized) — a real, now-confirmed gap, logged
  as a candidate follow-up, not built this session (Check 2 was investigate-only). (3) **ClippingPlanes** —
  confirmed ABSENT in this sibling project too (not just CC) — reassuring: CC isn't behind the ecosystem
  here, it's an unbuilt corner on both sides, validates deferring it rather than rushing untested camera
  math. (4) **Element order** — `XmlVisualizationInfo`'s Rust struct field order is `guid → perspective_
  camera/orthogonal_camera → components`, meaning (since their serde+quick-xml-style setup serializes in
  declaration order) their writer likely emits the camera choice BEFORE `<Components>` — the OPPOSITE of
  the true buildingSMART XSD sequence (`Components` → camera choice → `Lines` → `ClippingPlanes` →
  `Bitmap`) that CC's own Wave 3.1 exporter correctly follows (locked by the "precedes the camera element"
  test in `bcf-export.test.js`). Net: CC's own BCF viewpoint schema-order compliance looks MORE correct
  than this sibling tool's on this specific point — a positive validation of Wave 3.1, not a gap to close.
- ~~**Build 3: print-ready Data Quality report**~~ (2026-07-13). Research before writing any code turned up
  a course-correcting discovery: CC already has a mature, working report generator —
  `_ccClashReport(s)` (index.html:19446) — builds a self-contained HTML document (inline CSS, a
  `@media print{.noprint{display:none}}` block, a "Print / Save as PDF" button calling `window.print()`)
  and opens it via `window.open('','_blank')` + `document.write`. A third sibling,
  `generateValidationReport`, already covers IDS specs. So the real gap wasn't "CC has no report feature,"
  it was "Data Quality has no report feature" (only CSV export). Built `_ccDataQualityReport(s)` as a
  fourth report using the *identical* pattern (deliberately did not invent a shared modal/print-CSS system
  — see the superseded plan below) — Quality Score + breakdown, General/BIM-basics/ILS/RVB check tables,
  accessibility pass/fail, models table. Self-sufficient like `_ccClashReport` (re-runs the check engines
  from `s.models` directly, doesn't depend on `DataQualityPanel`'s own React state having already run).
  Wired into two entry points: a new "⎙ Print report" button in the DQ panel (renamed the pre-existing CSV
  button off the now-ambiguous "↓ Export report" to "↓ Export CSV"), and a new "⎙ Data quality report"
  entry in `IssuePanel`'s Export flyout next to the pre-existing "⎙ Clash report". 12 new tests across 2
  files (function-body extraction + sandboxed stub engines, same style as `bcf-export.test.js`; a grep-based
  wiring lock for both entry points). 206/206 passing.
  **Superseded plan, kept for the record**: before finding `_ccClashReport`, the plan was a jsPDF CDN
  dependency — dropped because this sandbox's CDN fetches 403 (couldn't self-verify an SRI hash, and a
  wrong hardcoded one would silently break the feature for every user), then a from-scratch
  modal+`window.print()` system — dropped once `_ccClashReport` showed the project already has a proven,
  simpler, dependency-free convention for exactly this. Lesson: grep for `window.print` /  `@media print`
  /  `⎙` before designing a new report/export feature from scratch — this file already has three.
- ~~**Fixed the `excludeSelf` single-model default trap**~~ (2026-07-13). `rules.excludeSelf` defaults
  `true`, and one-click "Run detection" runs with whatever rules currently are. For a project with only
  one combined IFC model (a common federated-export shape), `grpA`/`grpB` both resolve to that single
  model, so "cross-model only" always yields zero pairs by construction — the single most prominent
  first-run action silently reported "0 clashes" regardless of real physical overlaps. Fix is inside
  `_sweepAndPrune` (index.html:4605, takes `grpA`/`grpB` directly — no refactor needed to reach the right
  scope): reuses the `seenModels` map it already builds when merging `grpA.concat(grpB)` into `items`, and
  when that union collapses to exactly one model, forces `selfAllowed = true` for the same-model gating
  branch — covers both "only one model loaded globally" and a run explicitly scoped to one model on both
  sides (NL command / preset), since both collapse the same way. Deliberately does NOT mutate
  `rules.excludeSelf` itself (an effective-only override), so the dozens of UI/NL-command/preset call
  sites that SET it keep working unchanged, and multi-model behavior is provably unaffected (locked by a
  same-model-pair-must-still-be-excluded regression test). 7 tests extracting the real `_sweepAndPrune`
  (plain `{min:{x,y,z},max:{x,y,z}}` boxes, no THREE.js needed). `6d4ed0f`. 213/213 passing.
  **Companion follow-up, not done here**: the local ("exact") Python engine has the same trap in its own
  model-scope resolution — `_serializeForLocalEngine` (`addons/local-engine.js:586`) passes
  `rules.excludeSelf` through as-is and doesn't have access to the resolved `grpA`/`grpB` (it serializes
  ALL passed-in models unconditionally and lets the Python engine do its own `modelA`/`modelB` string
  resolution server-side), so the equivalent fix belongs in `ClashControlEngine`'s own sweep/scope code —
  a separate repo, out of this session's write scope, same situation as the Wave-0 local-engine rule-parity
  fix.
- ~~**Wave 4 (partial): copyable inspector IDs + Navigator real find**~~ (2026-07-13). Continuing "go full
  throttle to the end" past the user's explicit redirect (Build 1/3, Check 2) and the excludeSelf fix,
  back onto the roadmap:
  - **Copyable GlobalId/Express ID**: both were plain, unselectable-feeling text in the Details inspector
    (Coordinate's full Identity card + Present mode's truncated Quick identity card). New shared
    `_ccCopyToClipboard(text, label)` (clipboard API + execCommand fallback, toast confirmation instead of
    AIChatPanel's copyMsg per-index state, since these call sites have no natural index) wired via a small
    `_copyBtn` helper in `renderDetails`. The truncated Present-mode row copies the full untruncated
    GlobalId, not the visible ellipsis text. `3eca120`.
  - **Navigator search, two bugs found by reading the code before touching it, not just the one in the
    plan**: (1) every element-search call site (spatial view, tree/"Flat list" view, its keyboard-nav
    duplicate for arrow-key traversal, and `_findAndHighlightElements`/Items Finder used by NL commands)
    duplicated its own 2-6 field inline check — none matched GlobalId, so pasting a GlobalId from a BCF
    issue into the search box found nothing; none matched property/quantity VALUES either. (2) **bigger
    find**: the default "Hierarchy" (spatial) view — `viewMode==='spatial'`, what every new user sees
    first — never read `treeSearch` at all; `stEls`/`noSt` were rendered fully unfiltered, so the search
    box had literally zero effect in the default view. Only the secondary "Flat list" view actually
    filtered anything. New shared `_elMatchesSearch(el, q)`: name/ifcType/expressId (pre-existing) +
    GlobalId/ObjectType/material/description/storey + every pset/quantity value. All 5 call sites
    migrated onto it (removing the duplication as a side effect); spatial view now computes `q` and
    filters `stEls`/`noSt` like the other views always should have. Storey render caps (200/100 elements)
    widen to 1000/500 while actively searching — search is exactly the case where seeing more matters more
    than DOM-node headroom. `da26294`. 14 new tests across 4 files (matcher unit tests + grep-based wiring
    locks confirming no stale duplicated matcher text remains and the spatial view specifically computes
    `q`). 231/231 passing.
  - **Deliberately not done**: a "flat cross-model results list" (today's results still nest inside the
    per-model/per-storey tree, just correctly filtered now) and auto-expand-on-search (matching a node
    still requires manually expanding its ancestors, same as before) — both bigger, separate UX redesigns,
    not part of this fix's scope.
  - ~~**Selection Sets: rename + `+`/`−` membership editing**~~. `REN_SELSET` had a reducer case but
    genuinely zero dispatch call sites anywhere in the app — no rename button existed at all. Click a
    set's name to rename (wires the existing action). New `UPD_SELSET_REFS` reducer case (a dedicated case
    rather than delete+re-add, so a set's `createdAt`/`color` aren't reset by editing membership) backs new
    `+`/`−` buttons that add/remove the current selection from an already-saved set. `b89cd1e`.
  - ~~**Containment breadcrumb + hosted elements in the Details inspector**~~. The Coordinate workspace's
    Identity card only ever showed a bare storey string — no Project/Site/Building chain, no way to see
    what an element is hosting (e.g. a wall's doors/windows) — despite both data sets already existing
    (`spatialHierarchy` from `extractSpatialHierarchy`, `hostId` from the loader). New breadcrumb (each
    level included only when unambiguous — 0 or 2+ sites/buildings are omitted rather than guessed, with a
    fallback to the old plain row when nothing resolves) + a "Hosted elements" card, click to highlight /
    double-click to frame (same convention as the Navigator tree's own element nodes). `63534de`.
  - 17 more tests across 4 files this round (block-extraction + grep wiring locks). 248/248 passing.
  - **Still unstarted**: dynamic/re-resolving "search sets" (save a classification filter as a named query
    that re-evaluates against the live model, distinct from today's static snapshot-of-refs sets) and
    element-vs-element compare/diff (`multiSel` + `PropBlock` already exist and are used as stacked A/B in
    the clash panel — reusing them for an aligned diff view is the natural next step, just not started).
- ~~**Element-vs-element property diff (Wave 4)**~~ (2026-07-13). `multiSel` (Shift-click) + `PropBlock`
  already existed but only ever stacked two elements' properties as separate A/B blocks (`ClashProps`) —
  nothing aligned them side by side or flagged which actually differ. New `_diffElementProps(pA, pB)`:
  aligned rows for identity fields + the UNION of both sides' quantity/pset keys, so a property only one
  element carries shows as a row with the other side marked missing rather than silently dropped. New
  `PropDiffView` (3-column table, differing rows highlighted) wired into `NavigatorPanel`: selecting
  exactly 2 elements shows "Compare selected (2)". **Real bug found while wiring it up**: `_lookupElProps`
  required an exact `modelId` match, but Selection Sets/Navigator `multiSel` refs never populate `modelId`
  in practice (only one call site in the whole file ever sets it, and even that one falls back to `null`)
  — the new Compare view would have silently shown nothing. Fixed by falling back to searching every model
  by expressId alone, matching `_findMeshByRef`'s existing lenient convention exactly; `ClashProps` (the
  only pre-existing caller) is unaffected since clash items always carry real model ids. `3d725af`. 12
  tests across 2 files. 260/260 passing.
  **Process note for future sessions**: an `Edit` tool-call embedded a stray `\x01` control byte in place
  of an intended plain delimiter inside a hand-written string-join key (`setName+'\x01'+k`), which silently
  broke `Object.keys(...).sort()` grouping — caught immediately by re-running the exact-match `Edit` (it
  correctly refused to match, since the file's real bytes didn't equal what was intended) rather than by
  a test. Fixed via a small Node one-off (`cat -A` to confirm the exact byte, then `String.split/join` in
  a `node -e` script) instead of fighting the Edit tool's literal-text matching against an uncopyable
  control character. Lesson: if `Edit`'s exact-match unexpectedly fails on text you just read verbatim,
  suspect a hidden/control character before assuming a stale read — `cat -A` (or `od -c`) confirms it in
  one step, and a `node -e` `String.split/join` script sidesteps needing to type the character at all.
- **Wave 4 is now substantially done**: real find, copyable IDs, containment breadcrumb + hosted elements,
  Selection Set rename/`+`/`−` editing, and element-vs-element diff all shipped this session. **Still
  unstarted**: dynamic/re-resolving "search sets" (save a classification filter as a named query that
  re-evaluates against the live model — today's sets are still a static snapshot-of-refs; this is a
  bigger, separate feature: query definition UI + a live re-resolution engine + wiring into the clash-scope
  picker, not attempted this session).
- ~~**DQ re-run reconciliation (Wave 5)**~~ (2026-07-13). Clash detection has had full GUID-identity
  reconciliation (new/persisting/auto-resolved) since `#638`; Data Quality re-runs just overwrote the prior
  result with no trend at all — running the DQ panel twice gave no sense of whether things got better or
  worse. A true per-element identity diff (GlobalId × checkId) would need every check bucket to also return
  an uncapped GlobalId list — today `ex` is deliberately capped at 6-8 items for display, so that would be
  an engine-shape change across all four check engines (qc/bim/ils/rvb). Reconciled at the check-COUNT level
  instead ("was N, now M" per bucket), which needs no engine-shape change: new `flattenDQCounts(results)` /
  `diffDQCounts(current, previous)` (`addons/data-quality.js`, exposed as `window._ccFlattenDQCounts`/
  `window._ccDiffDQCounts`) flatten all four engines into one map keyed `engineName:bucketKey` (prefixed so
  same-named buckets in different engines, e.g. two different `noMaterial` checks in `qc` vs `ils`, never
  collide), then diff two snapshots into `{worse[], better[], unchangedCount}`, sorted by largest swing
  first. Wired into `DataQualityPanel.runChecks()`: computes `newQc`/`newBim`/`newIls`/`newRvb` as named
  locals (needed so they can be flattened before the setters run), flattens+diffs against the previous run's
  snapshot (`null` on the first run — nothing to compare against), stores the new snapshot as "previous" for
  next time. New "Since last run: N worse, M better" summary line under "Last checked", expandable (reusing
  the existing `expanded[...]` section-toggle pattern) into the full worse/better list with labels and
  from→to counts. **Deliberately session-local, not persisted** — `prevDqCounts` is component state, cleared
  on reload, matching how the rest of the DQ panel already behaves (no snapshot persistence exists anywhere
  else in Review mode either). `9d475b9`. 11 new tests across 2 files (`dq-reconciliation` — flatten/diff
  logic incl. engine-prefix collision avoidance and sort order; `dq-reconciliation-wiring` — panel wiring).
  Caught and fixed a stale assertion in `tests/rvb-panel-wiring.test.js` from the `runChecks()` refactor
  (literal-text match on `setRvb(runRVBChecks(rvbModels))`, now `var newRvb = ...; setRvb(newRvb)` —
  behavior-equivalent, just restructured) in a separate follow-up commit, `e4fa73a`. 271/271 passing.
- ~~**Fixed a real IDS honesty bug found while scoping the item below**~~ (2026-07-13). `runIDSSpecs`
  (`addons/data-quality.js:1200`) unconditionally counted a non-failed element as a pass in the per-spec
  `bs.pass`/`bs.fail` rollup, even when its only requirement came back "not checkable" (`elUnchecked`) — the
  requirement-level `summary.total/pass/fail` already excluded unchecked requirements correctly, but
  `bs.pass` (used by both `generateValidationReport` and the live IDS panel's pass-rate bar,
  `pass/(pass+fail)`) didn't, so a specification whose only applicable elements were unverifiable would
  render as 100% compliant. Fixed to `if (elFailed) bs.fail++; else if (!elUnchecked) bs.pass++;` — unchecked
  elements now contribute to `applicable`/`unchecked` but not `pass`/`fail`. `f075029`. One new assertion pair
  in the existing `partOf: ... honestly unchecked` test (`tests/ids-engine.test.js`), 271/271 passing.
- ~~**IDS conformance CI against the buildingSMART audit suite (Wave 5's last piece)**~~ (2026-07-13).
  Researched the actual corpus first rather than trusting IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md's own citation of it (that
  entry had flagged its own numbers as "search-synthesized" — worth re-verifying, not just building against):
  it's `github.com/buildingSMART/IDS` (not `IDS-Audit-tool`, which turned out to be a schema-validator, not a
  paired-test-case corpus), `development` branch,
  `Documentation/ImplementersDocumentation/TestCases/{attribute,classification,entity,ids,material,partof,
  property,restriction,tolerance}/`, confirmed 250+ pairs sharing a basename (`<prefix>-<slug>.ids`+`.ifc`,
  prefix ∈ pass/fail/invalid) — confirmed via `scripts.md` in that folder, not guessed. Names line up directly
  with the 4 subtle rules already flagged in this file's Wave 5 section (e.g.
  `property/pass-floating_point_numbers_are_compared_with_a_1e_6_tolerance_1_4`).
  **Verification constraint that shaped the whole design**: confirmed via direct test (not assumption) that
  this dev sandbox's proxy 403s the exact CDN hosts (`cdnjs.cloudflare.com`, `cdn.jsdelivr.net`) the app
  itself needs to boot — so unlike every other feature this session, the browser-driving part of this one
  could NOT be verified locally before shipping, only via a real GitHub Actions run. Split the work along
  that fault line: `tests/browser/ids-grade.js` — pure `gradeIDSCase(prefix, summary)` — is the one part that
  COULD be wrong in a subtle way (the corpus only has pass/fail/invalid; CC's engine has a 4th, honest
  "not checkable" outcome for facets it won't guess on, e.g. PredefinedType/non-storey partOf/XSD dataType
  coercion — naively grading those as "wrong" would repeat exactly the dishonest-number pattern Wave 0 spent
  this whole effort round eliminating), so it's pulled out standalone and unit-tested directly (10 tests, no
  browser/network). Everything downstream of it — `tests/browser/ids-conformance.mjs` (new sibling to
  `smoke.mjs`: fetches nothing itself, takes a corpus dir as argv[2], discovers every case, drives each one
  through `window.ClashControl.loadFiles` → real web-ifc → `window._ccParseIDS`/`_ccRunIDS` → `gradeIDSCase`,
  `DEL_MODEL`s before the next case) is comparatively thin plumbing, verified by careful reading only.
  **Two bugs caught by reading the loader before trusting it, not by running anything** (would have silently
  broken the whole job): (1) copied `smoke.mjs`'s scoped-load readiness signal (`m.stats.loadedScope`)
  at first — traced the loader and found `loadedScope` is explicitly `null` for a normal unscoped load
  (`index.html:3452`), so every one of the 250+ cases would have hung until timeout; switched to `m.stats`
  truthiness (set once, for any completed load, scoped or not). (2) reusing one model filename across cases
  to force `REPLACE_MODEL` (avoiding accumulation) would race the next case's "did it load yet" poll against
  the previous case's already-true state; switched to a unique per-case model name (plain `ADD_MODEL` every
  time) plus an explicit `DEL_MODEL` after grading each case, keeping the running app light across 250+
  iterations without the race. New workflow `.github/workflows/ids-conformance.yml`: **manual dispatch +
  weekly schedule only, deliberately not on every PR** — ~250+ headless-Chromium round trips is much heavier
  than `browser-smoke`, and shipping a new, page could-not-verify-locally job as a blocking gate on day one
  would risk breaking every unrelated PR on this repo; `continue-on-error:true` so it's visible but never
  blocks while it proves itself. Corpus fetched at `development` HEAD (not pinned) so a pass means "conformant
  with the CURRENT official suite" — fine while non-blocking; **pin to a commit before ever promoting this to
  a required check**, or an upstream corpus change could silently start blocking unrelated PRs. Tried to fire
  it once via `actions_run_trigger` for real signal this session — got a 403 (session's GitHub integration
  lacks `actions:write`), so **this job has NOT been run for real yet**; its first signal will be the Monday
  cron or a human clicking "Run workflow". `74de5ce` (grading logic + tests), `f25ee77` (driver + workflow).
  281/281 `npm test` passing throughout (the browser-driven `.mjs` itself is intentionally outside that count,
  same as `smoke.mjs`).
- ~~**BCF `<Visibility>`/`<Coloring>` export (Wave 3)**~~ (2026-07-13). Went to fetch the real
  `visinfo.xsd` (both `release_2_1` and `release_3_0`) before writing any code, since this session's own
  earlier Check 2 notes (secondary-source, read from a sibling Rust project rather than the schema itself)
  turned out to have the structure wrong — worth re-verifying, exactly the lesson the IDS-conformance item
  above just re-learned from a different angle. **Corrected understanding**: `<Coloring>` is a CHILD of
  `<Components>` (alongside `<Selection>`/`<Visibility>`), not a sibling of `<Components>` at the
  `VisualizationInfo` level as Check 2 had said. **Bigger, unrelated finding from reading the real schema**:
  `<Visibility>` has `minOccurs="1"` inside `ComponentVisibility` in BCF 2.1 — meaning every BCF 2.1 file CC
  had ever exported with a `<Components>` block (i.e. every clash-pair viewpoint) was already schema-invalid,
  missing a required element, before today. Fixed both in one pass since they're the same block: now always
  emits `<Visibility DefaultVisibility="true"/>` right after `<Selection>` whenever `<Components>` exists (3.0
  makes Visibility optional, but writing it explicitly avoids relying on 3.0's `DefaultVisibility="false"`
  schema default; CC has no per-viewpoint hidden-elements snapshot to export as `<Exceptions>`, so
  "everything visible, no exceptions" is the honest claim available today) — and `<Coloring>` for clash-pair
  items only (`globalIdA`+`globalIdB` both present), reusing the exact Wave 2.1 clash-focus A/B colors
  (`#ef4444`/`#22d3ee`, `_PAIR_ROLE_COLOR` in `_highlightRefs`) so a BCF viewer shows the pair the way CC
  itself does. **2.1 and 3.0 genuinely differ inside `<Color>`**: 2.1 holds `<Component>` directly, 3.0 wraps
  it in a nested `<Components>` — confirmed against both real XSDs, not assumed symmetric. Single-GUID items
  (DQ/accessibility issues) get Selection+Visibility but no Coloring — no second side to contrast against.
  Updated the pre-existing "deduplicated" test to scope its GUID-count assertion to `<Selection>` specifically
  (Coloring now legitimately repeats those GUIDs elsewhere in the file — counting across the whole file would
  no longer test what it originally meant to). 5 new tests. `5945f31`. 286/286 passing.
  **Still open from Wave 3**: `<ClippingPlanes>` export (doubly-confirmed as a shared, not CC-specific, gap
  per Check 2 — deferred, not rushed), auto-synthesized default viewpoints for issues with no linked view, and
  stamp/auto-assignment rules (Revizto-style per-project templates).
- ~~**Dynamic search sets (Wave 4's last item)**~~ (2026-07-13). Scoped first (Explore agent): the only
  existing structured (not free-text) element-filter code anywhere in the file is the legacy IDS engine's
  applicability/requirement facets (`ifcType` regex + pset-scoped property, ~19452-19475) — modeled the query
  shape on that instead of inventing a DSL: `{ifcType, storey, material, propertySet, propertyName,
  propertyValue}`, AND'd together. New pure `_resolveSearchSet(query, models)` next to `_elMatchesSearch`
  (deliberately not sharing code with it — structured vs. free-text are different problems). New `s.searchSets`
  state + `ADD_SEARCHSET`/`DEL_SEARCHSET`/`REN_SEARCHSET`/`UPD_SEARCHSET_QUERY` — a **separate slice from
  `selectionSets`**, not a `query` field bolted on: every existing selSet consumer (count display,
  `_highlightRefs`, the `+`/`−` editor) assumes already-resolved refs, and a query-defined set has no coherent
  `+`/`−` operation anyway (the query is what's authoritative, not the membership). UI: a parallel "Search
  sets" section in the Navigator — query-builder form (6 filter fields + name, live match-count preview,
  refuses to save with zero criteria) and a list reusing the exact same `_highlightRefs` Isolate/Highlight
  buttons Selection Sets already wired up, plus click-to-edit. `saveProject`/`loadProject` round-trip the
  QUERY, not resolved refs — correct even through the stub-reload cycle (restored models start with
  `elements:[]` until geometry is re-uploaded, so a search set's count honestly reads 0 until then, rather
  than a thawed selSet's stale non-zero count). `9f2088c`. 23 new tests across 2 files, 309/309 passing.
  **Deliberately out of scope** (confirmed by the scoping research, not just deferred on a hunch): wiring a
  search set into the clash-matrix or clash-scope picker — no "scope detection to an arbitrary named set"
  plumbing exists anywhere today, would need a new expressId-membership check in `_sweepAndPrune` alongside
  `excludeTypes` (itself real, but a separate follow-up); `colorByClass`/`TOGGLE_CLASS_VIS` integration — those
  key off classification buckets, not ref lists, so a search set isn't a natural fit there.
  **Wave 4 is now fully done**: real find, copyable IDs, containment breadcrumb + hosted elements, Selection
  Set rename/`+`/`−` editing, element-vs-element diff, and dynamic search sets all shipped this session.
- ~~**Auto-synthesized default BCF viewpoints (Wave 3)**~~ (2026-07-13). Scoped first since this looked like
  it might be another `<ClippingPlanes>`-shaped deferral ("needs live scene state that only exists inside
  reducer-driven effects, not a pure function") — it wasn't: every element already carries a real world-space
  bbox on `state.models[i].elements[j].box` (the same authoritative data `window._ccElemsBBox` already unions
  live), flowing into `exportBCF`'s existing `state` parameter with zero new plumbing. The one thing genuinely
  unavailable at export time is a "current camera angle" to imitate (no live Three.js scene), so the
  synthesized camera always uses a fixed isometric-ish offset rather than guessing one. New
  `_lookupElBox`/`_ccBoxFinite`/`_ccSynthesizeViewpoint` (placed right before `exportBCF`, their only caller):
  handles both identity shapes issues carry — `elemA`/`elemB`+`modelAId`/`modelBId` (clash pairs, unions both
  boxes) and `elementId`/`modelId` (single-element DQ/accessibility issues) — falling through to no
  synthesized viewpoint (today's existing behavior) when nothing resolves, rather than fabricating a
  meaningless generic camera with no real geometry behind it. Distance formula duplicated from the private
  `_zoomDist` (different closure) rather than exposed cross-scope — same reasoning as the Coloring commit's
  inline color literals. `bca65a9`. 13 new tests across 2 files. 322/322 passing.
  **Still open from Wave 3**: `<ClippingPlanes>` export (deferred, confirmed shared gap not CC-specific) and
  stamp/auto-assignment rules (Revizto-style per-project templates — "no existing infrastructure found").
- ~~**Stamp/auto-assignment rules (Wave 3's last item)**~~ (2026-07-13). Revizto-style per-project templates,
  "discipline-pair × storey → assignee/priority", applied automatically to newly detected clashes. Scoped
  first: clashes already carry a `disciplines` array (`_buildClashBase`) and `elemAStorey`/`elemBStorey`
  directly — no new extraction needed, just consumption. New `_ccMatchAssignmentRule`/`_ccApplyAssignmentRules`
  (pure, next to `mergeDetectionResults`) stamp only `c._delta==='new'` clashes with no assignee yet —
  deliberately NOT touching `mergeDetectionResults` itself, whose persisting-clash branch already carries
  forward a person's prior assignee/priority unconditionally. Disciplines match as an UNORDERED pair (a
  clash's two sides carry no meaningful A/B order) with `'any'` wildcards; first matching rule wins.
  New `s.assignmentRules` reducer slice, deliberately separate from `StandardsPanel`'s existing
  discipline-pair clearance rules (those are global, plain `localStorage` — assignment policy is
  project-specific), wired into all three persistence paths from day one (the previous commit's fix made
  that possible to get right first try). UI lives inside `StandardsPanel` as a new "Assignment rules"
  section — critically uses `DISC` (`structural/mep/architectural/civil/other`, what a clash's
  `disciplines[]` actually carries) for its dropdowns, NOT `StandardsPanel`'s own `STANDARD_DISCIPLINES`
  list (`mechanical`/`electrical`/...), which the scoping research flagged would silently never match
  anything. `85edeb4`. 22 new tests across 2 files, 348/348 passing.
  **Wave 3 is now done except `<ClippingPlanes>` export**, deliberately deferred (confirmed via Check 2 as a
  shared gap, not CC-specific — validates the deferral rather than rushing untested camera/section math).
- ~~**Occluder-reveal toggle (Wave 2.2)**~~ (2026-07-13). The first render-adjacent feature this session —
  scoped carefully first against this project's own documented guardrails (never touch renderer/tone-mapping;
  additive-only; must handle BatchedMesh/InstancedMesh) before writing anything. Confirmed via research: needs
  zero renderer/material/postFX changes — pure `THREE.Raycaster.intersectObjects` scene-graph visibility,
  the exact pattern already used at 14+ call sites for picking, just aimed at a world point instead of the
  mouse. New `_ccResolveOccluderHits`/`_ccApplyOccluderHide`/`_ccRevealOccluders` (pure) +
  `_ccHideOccluders` (the one impure entry point — builds a real `Raycaster` from camera to the active
  clash's point, bounded short of it, excludes the pair as a second safety net) placed next to `ghostOthers`.
  **Deliberately never calls `ghostOthers`/`unghostAll`** — occluder-hide is strictly additive on top of
  whatever ghost state clash-focus already set up, using each mesh type's own native hide primitive (the
  same ones `ghostOthers` itself uses for the kept set): regular Mesh `.visible=false`; InstancedMesh
  `setMatrixAt(idx,_INST_HIDE_MX)`; BatchedMesh `setVisibleAt(idx,false)`. **Verified this mattered**: the
  more obvious reuse candidate, `_ccTempHide`, has no InstancedMesh branch at all and would have silently
  no-op'd on instanced elements. New "Hide occluders" button in `IssueRow`'s active-clash button row, local
  `useState`+`useRef` (transient viewport state, not reducer), a `useEffect` keyed on `[active]` reveals any
  stale hide when the row stops being focused (guards a virtualized-list row staying mounted across a J/K
  navigation) — deliberately does not touch the existing J/K keyboard handler itself at all.
  **Testing ceiling stated plainly** (matches the IDS-conformance item's honesty, not overclaimed): unlike
  every other feature this session, no CI job exercises live Three.js scene mutation, so `_ccHideOccluders`
  itself is untested — it's pure glue with no logic of its own. Everything that could actually be wrong (hit
  resolution across all 3 mesh types, pair exclusion, dedup, native hide/reveal) is pure and unit-tested
  against plain-object THREE stand-ins. `633251e`. 21 new tests across 2 files. 369/369 passing.
- **Next**: `<ClippingPlanes>` export (Wave 3's one remaining piece — still deliberately deferred, not
  attempted this session), **watching the first real `ids-conformance` Actions run** (manual or the Monday
  cron) and acting on whatever it finds — false positives/negatives in `wrong`, or a corpus-fetch/harness bug
  in `errored` — since that's the one feature this session that shipped without any local verification
  (occluder-reveal above is now a second, smaller instance of the same honestly-stated gap), and Wave 6
  (Scale — untouched; extra care required per this session's own
  history-informed guardrails: no geo-cache keying changes, no hand-rolled geometry merging). Wave 2.4
  (Edges + SSAO in normal viewing) is the one remaining Wave 2 item — also render-touching, but unlike
  occluder-reveal it directly implicates the SAO/Outline postFX passes this project's guardrails single out
  by name ("re-enable only as opt-in, without SMAA, verified on batched models before any default flip") —
  approach with proportionally more caution.

On branch `claude/codebase-review-optimization-3nltcw` (2026-07-08) — four-repo review sweep (in progress):  **[STALE?]**

- Two-round audit of ClashControl + Connector + Engine + SmartBridge (superseded). Fix wave in flight: core dead features (ClashControl.version / _ccFlyToMeasurement / palette Fit), IFC-worker watchdog re-arm, shared-project data-loss merge, JS coplanar NaN guard, WASM-path LRU registration, backend (title/triage model verify, project.js editKey + batched upsert, tile.js validation), daily-sync repair, doc/memory reconciliation. Engine + Connector fixes on same-named branches in their repos (release-pipeline workflow_call fix, all-vs-all dedup, coplanar branch, modelFilter exclude semantics, quantities/description emission).

On branch `claude/loam-api-stability-enrichment-gxh8gc` (2026-06-15) — Loam API stability + enrichment:  **[STALE?]**

- **Loam's 5-point request triaged against the live bridge surface.** Points 1 (classification + storeyA/storeyB on get_clashes), 3 (uniqueIdA/B + storey + classification on get_issues) and 4 (ingest_detection_feedback, byRule/byPair) were ALREADY shipped (#639–#646) — confirmed in `addons/smart-bridge.js` (get_clashes ~478, get_issues ~580, ingest_detection_feedback ~882). Point 5 (stable weekly detection config) **skipped per user.**
- **Point 2 BUILT — new `get_data_quality` MCP tool** (the named gap: Loam defaults to `get_data_quality`, overridable via `LOAM_CC_DQ_TOOL`; CC only had per-element `get_element_quality`). New `handlers.get_data_quality` in `addons/smart-bridge.js` (after get_element_quality): flattens all elements, runs `_ccRunDataQualityChecks` + `_ccRunBIMModelChecks` (both guarded), rolls checks into headline buckets **completeness / materials / brokenLinks / naming / classification / geometry** (per-bucket 0-100 sub-score via the same weighted-failure-ratio as the Quality Score chip + raw flaggedCount), overall score/grade from `_ccComputeQualityScore` (reconciles 1:1 with the in-app chip), plus a flat `checks[]`. Stable numeric fields for Loam's pulse. Declared in the addon `_TOOL_MANIFEST` and `mcp-server.js` TOOLS (forwarding is generic — `callBridge(name)` → `handlers[name]`, no allowlist). Optional `modelId` to scope to one model.
- **Not browser-verified in sandbox** — `node --check` passes on both files; handler is pure logic over plain element objects. First real run = Smart Bridge connected with a model loaded.
- **SEO/AEO push (to break into AI "best free IFC viewer" lists):** (1) new `/best-free-ifc-viewer/` comparison page (ItemList + SoftwareApplication + FAQPage schema, side-by-side table vs Open IFC Viewer/BIMvision/usBIM/Dalux/Bonsai/FZKViewer) — the listicle shape answer engines extract; (2) homepage Organization + WebSite @graph + `sameAs` (GitHub) for entity recognition; (3) **de-orphaned landing pages** — the app linked to none of them; added a crawlable internal-links `<nav>` in the hidden SEO block + noscript fallback; (4) new **`/tour/` explanatory page** (full feature breakdown + Q&A + schema) with a **functional hero**: dropped/chosen IFC is stashed in IndexedDB (db `cc-handoff`, store `pending`, key `file`) then redirects to `/?load=1`; a guarded boot hook at the end of index.html reads it and calls `window._ccLoadFiles([file])`; `/?connect=revit` auto-opens the Revit bridge. WelcomePopup got a "New here? Take the tour." link. All pages in sitemap. SW is network-first for navigations so the static pages aren't hijacked by the SPA. **Decision: subdir, NOT a subdomain** (subdomain splits SEO authority). Off-repo still needed: AlternativeTo/G2/Capterra listings, listicles, Reddit/LinkedIn. **Not browser-verified** — JSON-LD + all scripts parse via node.
- **De-duplicated the tool catalog (follow-up):** the tool surface was declared twice — the addon `_TOOL_MANIFEST` (dynamic, pushed to the bridge → served at `GET /tools`) AND `mcp-server.js` `TOOLS` (static). The two "routes" (MCP stdio via mcp-server.js; REST/`/chat`/OpenAPI via smart-bridge-server.js) actually CONVERGE — mcp-server.js's `callBridge` just `fetch`es the same bridge (`/call/<tool>` on 19803) → WS → the one set of browser `handlers`. mcp-server.js is a thin MCP-protocol shim, not a separate impl. Made the addon manifest the single source of truth: `mcp-server.js` now fetches `GET /tools` at `tools/list` time (`getTools()`, cached once reachable, 3 s timeout) and falls back to the hardcoded `TOOLS` only when the bridge isn't connected yet (MCP clients ask for the catalog at spawn, before a browser is up). Call validation accepts a name in either list. New tools now only need declaring in the addon `_TOOL_MANIFEST`.

On branch `claude/sharp-rubin-tlowao` (2026-06-13) — start-screen Revit live link:  **[STALE?]**

- **4th option on the Welcome/start screen**: added a "Live link to Revit…" row (under "Watch a folder…") in `WelcomePopup` (index.html ~30723). Activates the `revit-bridge` addon then dispatches `{t:'REVIT_BRIDGE',v:true}` to open the Revit Bridge panel — same proven pattern as the "+Add → Live from Revit" menu entry (`_ccActivateAddon('revit-bridge')` first, since addon reducerCases only run when the addon is active). Uses the string action literal `'REVIT_BRIDGE'` (the close handler does too); `A.REVIT_BRIDGE` is not a defined A-key.

Eleventh batch (2026-06-12) — CRS-aware geo-placement (proj4 reprojection, completes the v5.16.2 geoplace work):  **[STALE?]**

- ~~**Projected CRS → WGS84 reprojection in `addons/geoplace.js`**: the loader already extracts IFC4 `IfcMapConversion` → `IfcProjectedCRS` (eastings/northings/grid-rotation/EPSG) but only displayed it. Now a georeferenced model auto-places without typing lat/lon. New globals: `_ccCRSList` (selector data), `_ccCRSResolve` (IFC TargetCRS.Name → EPSG key — handles `EPSG:28992`, URN, bare code, names), `_ccReprojectToWGS84(E,N,key)`, `_ccGeoplaceFromCRS(modelId,mc,key)` (reproject → existing `_ccGeoplaceModel`; north/elev flow through the existing path which already prefers map-conversion rotation). proj4 lazy-loaded from jsdelivr (`proj4@2.20.9`, CSP script-src already allows the host; no SRI, same as web-ifc/spark runtime loads) only when a projection is requested. CRS registry (8 systems, def strings carry 7-param towgs84 → no grid file): RD New 28992, Belgian Lambert 31370, CH1903+/LV95 2056, OSGB 27700, ETRS89 UTM 31N/32N, Web Mercator, WGS84. **Placement-grade (~1 m), NOT RDNAPTRANS survey-grade** (full RD needs the NTv2 grid + quasi-geoid — deliberately not shipped). UI: Geo Placement panel — when a model has projected E/N and isn't placed yet, a CRS `<select>` (defaults to detected EPSG or 28992) + "Place from CRS" button; "· unrecognised" badge when the IFC names a CRS not in the registry. Guards: missing E/N, unrecognised CRS, out-of-range reprojection all reject with a clear message. 8 tests in tests/geoplace-crs.test.js (proj4 stubbed — geodesy is proj4's job).~~ (2026-06-12)
- **Deferred (as planned):** auto-aligning federated models by map conversion (touches model transforms — riskier); true RDNAPTRANS grids (megabytes, survey-grade opt-in); vertical datum selector (NAP-vs-ellipsoid is a constant offset, already handled +43 m for tiles). North-sign convention bit us before (negated after live test) — verify map-conversion rotation on a real georeferenced model before trusting it.
- **NOT browser-verified in sandbox** (jsdelivr host-blocked, no GPU/sample IFC): geoplace.js syntax-checked, main inline script parses via `new Function`, 8 reprojection tests pass with proj4 stubbed. First real run = Vercel preview with a georeferenced IFC (RD New is the easy NL test).

Tenth batch (2026-06-12) — IDS 1.0 execution engine (transposing the ifc-ids-mcp capability, Phase 1):  **[STALE?]**

- ~~**Full buildingSMART IDS 1.0 engine in `addons/data-quality.js`** (`window._ccParseIDS` + `window._ccRunIDS`): user asked to "transpose" github.com/vinnividivicci/ifc-ids-mcp (Python MCP wrapper over IfcTester) into our ecosystem — capability re-implemented in JS from the published standard, no code ported (IfcTester is LGPL). Parser is a hand-written dependency-free XML parser (no DOMParser → Node-testable). Facets: entity (EXACT match per spec — fixes legacy substring bug where IFCWALL matched IfcWallStandardCase), attribute (Name/Description/GlobalId/ObjectType/LongName), property (pset+baseName+value, Qto_/BaseQuantities → flattened quantities), classification (pset-key heuristics), material (segment split), partOf (storey containment only). Restrictions: enumeration, pattern (XSD→JS anchored `^(?:…)$`; \i \c / class subtraction → not-checkable), bounds, length; numeric tolerance + boolean spelling variants. Cardinality: facet required/optional/prohibited + spec-level via applicability min/maxOccurs. **Honesty rule: anything un-evaluable (PredefinedType, non-storey partOf, dataType, unsupported regex) reports "not checkable" — never silently passes.** Core wiring: `parseIDSXml` delegates to addon when loaded (tags specs `__ids2`), `runIDSValidation` routes them to `_ccRunIDS`, panel shows per-spec notes/partially-checked counts; legacy regex path kept as no-addon fallback + for bundled specs. `importIDS` rebuilt on the same parser. 15 tests in tests/ids-engine.test.js incl. round-trip of our own exportIDS output. Merged as #622.~~ (2026-06-12)
- **Phase 2 (queued):** CI conformance job comparing verdicts vs IfcTester on shared fixtures (pip in CI only); extract PredefinedType + Tag in the loader so those facets stop being "not checkable"; dataType checking.
- **Phase 3 (queued):** IDS authoring tools on `mcp-server.js` (create_ids/add_*_facet/export, mirroring ifc-ids-mcp's tool surface) so an AI can author a spec via Smart Bridge and run it against the live federation.

Doc added (2026-06-11): **`AS_BUILT_DEVIATION.md`** — scope/roadmap for point-cloud-vs-BIM surface deviation. Captures the capability audit (alignment + bbox-proxy heatmap exist; true point-to-surface distance is NOT built, deferred to "Phase 2" in `align.js`), reuse-vs-build (BVH + `_getWorldTris` triangle soup + Rust engine all reusable; net-new = point-to-triangle primitive + BVH closest-point descent + Rust kernel), the Phase 1/2/3 plan (~1wk demo / ~3–4wk client-grade), and the Wkb/Bbl **Borger** product framing (sell the dossier outcome, not the geometry; scan verifies the *geometric subset* of Bbl risk items only). Not built — awaiting go-ahead.  **[STALE?]**

Ninth batch (2026-06-11) — 3D world context live-test round 3:  **[STALE?]**

- ~~**PDOK tiles all failed to parse** ("setMeshoptDecoder must be called before loading compressed files", 21/21 failed): PDOK 3d-basisvoorziening glbs use EXT_meshopt_compression and the renderer's GLTFLoader had no decoders. tiles.js now registers GLTFExtensionsPlugin with MeshoptDecoder + DRACOLoader + KTX2Loader (latter two for Google photorealistic tiles, same wall). Merged as #619 → main `2bc3b62`. User confirmed PDOK buildings render.~~ (2026-06-11)
- **Geo align nudge** (PR #620): panel `align` row (camera-relative arrows + step select) slides basemap + tiles together in world XZ metres; offset persisted on model georef (offsetX/offsetZ), reapplied on rebuild/auto-restore/context reload. APIs: `_ccGeoplaceSetOffset`, `_ccSetTiles3DOffset`/`_ccTiles3DOffset`, `opts.offset` on `_ccLoadTiles3D`. Applied AFTER north rotation (world space) in both layers.
- **Site clearing** (PR #620): `Site: keep / Clear +N m` select carves context inside the models' union footprint + margin using 4 vertical clip planes with clipIntersection (PDOK/Google merge many buildings per mesh → per-building hiding impossible). Gotcha: core flips `renderer.localClippingEnabled` off when no section is active — tiles frame handler re-asserts it while clearing is on. Persisted in localStorage `cc_tiles3d_clear` (-1 = off).

Eighth batch (2026-06-10 evening, merged as #614 → main `92a4bbc`) — live-test loop round 2:  **[STALE?]**

- ~~**Sections cut nothing on batched models**: all four per-material clipping sweeps (section plane apply, section box apply, box clear, floor-plan cut) gated on `expressId==null && !isInstancedMesh` which excludes every BatchedMesh — sweeps now include `userData._isCCBatch`. Pattern to remember: ANY scene material sweep written pre-batching probably has this filter; render-style swap on batches still unaudited (cosmetic).~~ (2026-06-10)
- ~~**Section drag inverted**: axis path negated the screen-projected dot (horizontal cut ran against the mouse); picked-face custom planes used raw screen-Y. Now: project travel direction (+axis or custom normal) from the gizmo position, pos follows the mouse component.~~ (2026-06-10)
- ~~**Batched click-outline invisible on most elements** (#610/#612): off-scene originals are parentless so matrixWorld was stale identity — outline drew at the origin. Refresh from .matrix (updateMatrixWorld on parentless), outline ALL meshes of multi-body elements; same guard in bbox fallback + _buildHighlightGroupForMesh.~~ (2026-06-10)
- ~~**Geo anchor unification**: basemap half-tile drift fixed (grid centred on the *tile*, plane treated canvas centre as anchor — ~47 m at z18); tiles3d anchors at model bbox centre via `opts.origin` (was scene origin); NL preset height +43 m (PDOK = ECEF/ellipsoidal, NAP ≈ ellipsoid − 43); tiles load-error toast; streaming pump (update() only ran on rendered frames → downloads stalled when camera idle); 'load-tileset' event name; radius plugin takes anchor ECEF directly.~~ (2026-06-10)
- ~~**North from IFC**: loader reads IfcGeometricRepresentationContext.TrueNorth via IfcProject.RepresentationContexts (no type constant); `window._ccModelNorthDeg` prefers IfcMapConversion.rotationDeg over TrueNorth; **applied sign NEGATED after live test** (first deploy doubled the rotation error — XAxisAbscissa/Ordinate semantics in the wild are inverted vs my spec reading); fresh model value overrides persisted trueNorthDeg (self-heals old-sign saves). If a future model rotates wrong again, suspect per-authoring-tool sign differences → add a flip toggle.~~ (2026-06-10)
- ~~**Geo per-project**: basemap + tiles detach on `cc-project-switch` (geoplace re-runs _autoRestore for the new project's saved georef; tiles clears cc_tiles3d_on quietly).~~ (2026-06-10)
- ~~**Integrations → avatar menu**: topbar + mobile header buttons removed; single "Integrations" row in AvatarMenu with left flyout (Revit Connector / Clash Engine / Smart Bridge); `window._ccAddonsFocus` filters AddonsPanel to that one card + "Show all integrations" escape (focus clears on panel unmount).~~ (2026-06-10)
- ~~**AI counting**: `count_elements` tool in api/nl.js TOOLS + client case in dispatchServerAction (matches props.ifcType substring after ifc-strip/singularise, props.storey substring; storey-name suggestions on zero match) + offline regex in processNLCommand (EN+NL). Groq 400 tool_use_failed → one retry without tools → text answer instead of 502.~~ (2026-06-10)

- **NOT a CI flake this time (post-mortem)**: pull_request events stopped after a5f2d4a because **#612 had been merged from the UI at 19:13** — later pushes had no open PR, so no pull_request events; "cannot be reopened" = it was merged, not closed. Remedy that works either way: open a NEW PR for the branch. Before assuming the event flake, check whether the PR is still open.

On branch `claude/codebase-review-ae7481` (2026-06-10) — codebase review: connect open ends + fix bucket:  **[STALE?]**

- ~~**WASM clash engine connected for the first time.** It was never wired: `'wasm-engine'` missing from `addonFiles` AND `addons/wasm-engine-pkg/` never built/committed — the documented 4-8× acceleration never ran. Built `engine/` (wasm32 + wasm-bindgen 0.2.123, 35 KB), committed the pkg, added to the load list. **Critical fix while wiring:** the addon eagerly defined `_ccWasmIntersect`/`_ccWasmMinDist`/`_ccWasmBatchIntersect` with not-ready returns (false/Infinity/[]) while the core treats their *existence* as "skip JS fallback" — a failed/in-flight load would have silently reported zero clashes. Globals now publish only after successful init, unpublish on deactivate; `active:true/false` dispatched so the engine pill + Settings selector (which read `s.wasmEngine.active`, never set before) work. Node smoke test passes; verify the pill on Vercel preview.~~ (2026-06-10)
- ~~Bridge URL bug fixed (`smart-bridge-server.js`): `new URL('/v1/...', baseUrl)` dropped path prefixes (Groq/OpenRouter). New `llmEndpointUrl()` appends, skips double `/v1`; applied to callLlmApi + probeLlm; bridge 0.3.0→0.3.1; regression test `tests/bridge-url.test.js`.~~ (2026-06-10)
- ~~`UPD_OPENAEC_BRIDGE` was a silent no-op (no reducerCases registered) — addon now registers initState+reducerCases → `s.openaecBridge` tracks {available,checking,port,info}.~~ (2026-06-10)
- ~~`/api/project` (only unauthenticated DB-write) had no body cap — swapped bare rateLimit for `llmGuard` 30/min + 256 KB; 413 test added.~~ (2026-06-10)
- ~~Doc drift: CLAUDE/INTERNALS/PERFORMANCE_NOTES/OPEN_SOURCE_COMPONENTS/MEMORY still said Three.js r128 — corrected to r180 ESM import map; 2 "OBB engine" tooltips → AABB+BVH.~~ (2026-06-10)
- ~~Dead code: removed suggestOmniClass+_aiResJson, _ccLoadScript, _ccFormatLen (dup of _ccFmtLength), _ccDrawTitleBlock/ScaleBar/NorthArrow (dead duplicates of the inline 2D-sheet drawing) — ~136 lines.~~ (2026-06-10)
- ~~PWA offline was broken for addons: fetch handler only runtime-caches CDN hosts, addons weren't precached → 404 offline. All 15 addons + wasm pkg added to PRECACHE (cache name rotates per release).~~ (2026-06-10)
- **Deliberately skipped:** hiding model names from `/api/health` — Settings intentionally displays the live model (e840a79) and it's public in llms.txt; hiding it would regress a feature for negligible gain.
- **Chunk-merge caveat list is moot:** the whole chunk-merge subsystem was removed in 704837f (2026-06-09) — the Stage 2B "~15 visibility / ~34 color setters not chunk-aware" follow-up no longer applies. This session removed the orphaned write-only `_ccHiddenReg` registry the removal left behind. If chunk-merge ever returns, it returns with its own registry.  **[STALE?]**

Second batch same branch (2026-06-10) — product features + test infra ("do all 1-9"):  **[STALE?]**

- ~~Run history + trend: `s.runHistory` (capped 100) appended on MERGE_CLASHES, persisted in .ccproject + IndexedDB autosave; sparkline in ClashStatsBar "This run" row.~~ (2026-06-10)
- ~~Clash coordination report: `_ccClashReport(s)` print-to-PDF window (align.js pattern) — cover cards, models, rules summary, runHistory trend chart+table, clusters ranked by open count (cap 300), viewpoint snapshot appendix. Export dropdown entry.~~ (2026-06-10)
- ~~BCF 3.0 export made actually valid (verified against official buildingSMART release_3_0 XSDs): viewpoints inside Topic, Labels/Label wrapper (importer parses both shapes now), Files/IsExternal header, lowercase GUIDs, AspectRatio, no bogus xmlns, no DetailedVersion; DocumentReferences moved inside Topic (was invalid in BOTH versions). Locked by tests/bcf-export.test.js. BCF-API client NOT done (needs live OAuth server).~~ (2026-06-10)
- ~~`_ccBenchEngine(pairLimit)` console helper: JS vs WASM narrow-phase A/B on real overlapping pairs + hit-count parity check. Run after a detection.~~ (2026-06-10)
- ~~Browser smoke test: tests/fixtures/smoke-clash.ifc (hand-written IFC4, two crossing walls, verified to parse under web-ifc 0.0.77) + tests/browser/smoke.mjs (Playwright headless Chromium, real WASM pipeline, real detection) + ci.yml browser-smoke job + `ClashControl.runDetection()`. NOT run locally (Playwright CDN blocked in sandbox) — first execution is CI on the PR.~~ (2026-06-10)
- ~~Globals discipline: rule in CLAUDE.md (public surface → window.ClashControl.*); namespace grew loadFiles/runDetection/benchEngine/clashReport.~~ (2026-06-10)

Seventh batch (2026-06-10) — 3D Tiles world context (the June-22 That-Open-launch flex):  **[STALE?]**

- **addons/tiles.js**: NASA-AMMOS 3DTilesRendererJS 0.4.28 ESM (bare `three` resolves via the page import map → shares core r180; splat precedent). Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles via GoogleCloudAuthPlugin (BYO Map Tiles API key, localStorage `cc_google_tiles_key`) or any tileset URL. Georef: anchor lat/lon → `WGS84_ELLIPSOID.getEastNorthUpFrame` → invert → rotX(-90°) so the anchor sits at scene origin Y-up; the IFC never moves. Per-frame `tiles.update()` on the core's `cc-render-frame`; streaming events call invalidate so render-on-demand keeps painting. UI: "🌍 3D world context…" in Geo Placement (prefills from IfcSite/manual georef). CSP connect-src += tile.googleapis.com. NOT browser-verified in-session — needs a real key on the preview; ENU→Y-up sign convention is the thing to eyeball first (if the city is mirrored/under the model, flip the rotX sign).
- Same batch: batched-click selection fully fixed (#604 merged: per-instance tiebreak bounds + click outline/bbox from off-scene originals); local-engine boot probe gated on 'seen' flag.

Sixth batch (2026-06-10) — perf plan after user's laggy 7-model federation (USER APPROVED — Phases 0+1+2 SHIPPED on the branch; verify _ccRenderReport() on the real federation before/after, then consider widening the trigger):  **[STALE?]**

- **Lag root cause (user log):** ZDS_BWK_PDR_gevelbekleding — 2,510 elements, 74,772 UNIQUE geometries, 0 reused → ~75k meshes/draw calls from one cladding model. Instancing can't help (nothing repeats).
- **Why all past merge attempts failed (from revert 366c7cc + MEMORY):** hand-rolled chunk-merge on r128 broke identity features — (1) same-material elements visually blended, (2) render-style switch no-op on chunks, (3) selection outlines blended, (4) hide/color needed index-rebuild registries, ~49 setters never became chunk-aware. Removed entirely in 704837f. Free-RAM/dehydrate = wrong problem (RAM not draw calls), removed.
- **PLAN (BatchedMesh, post-r180 — the primitive that didn't exist during prior attempts):**
  - Phase 0: `_ccRenderReport()` (draw calls via renderer.info, frame time, per-model mesh counts); acceptance gates: ≥30fps orbit on the user's federation AND hide/color/style/pick/outline identical to per-element.
  - Phase 1: THREE.BatchedMesh for pathological models only (trigger: geoUnique/elements > 10 OR >20k meshes/model). Original per-element meshes kept off-scene as proxies (proven Stage 2A pattern — element.meshes[] stays source of truth for clash/serialize/outline). Identity features via natives: setVisibleAt (hide), setColorAt (color-by-class), raycast batchId→expressId (pick), .material swap (render styles).
  - Phase 2: every historical revert symptom becomes a browser-smoke CI assertion on a batched model BEFORE any default-on expansion.
  - Phase 3 (parallel): storey-picker UI for scoped loading; Tauri Phase 2 native engine.

Fifth batch (2026-06-10) — declared units + registry; scoped-loading design queued:  **[STALE?]**

- ~~Declared IFC LENGTHUNIT extraction (`_ccExtractIfcLengthUnit`) wired: load → result.stats.unitScale → geo-cache persist → `_ccDetectUnitScale` precedence override>declared>spacing-heuristic. tests/ifc-units.test.js locks it.~~ (2026-06-10)
- ~~Port/protocol registry: INTERNALS.md §22 — all companion-app contracts in one table.~~ (2026-06-10)
- ~~Storey-scoped loading SHIPPED (core): `ClashControl.loadFiles(files,{storeys})` one-shot batch scope → both load paths skip out-of-scope geometry pre-decode; stats.loadedScope/scopedOutCount; partial loads never write geo-cache; 'partial' badge on model row + `_ccReloadModelFull` one-click full reload; smoke test asserts the filter end-to-end.~~ (2026-06-10) ~~**Remaining: pre-load storey-picker modal UI.**~~ Shipped: `StoreyPickerModal` (`index.html:24856`, wired via `window._ccShowStoreyPicker`). (2026-07-08, confirmed by audit)
- ~~Tauri Phase 0 scaffold: desktop/ (Tauri v2 conf + main.rs + build-dist.sh, sw.js excluded from dist) + release-desktop.yml (matrix installers via tauri-action, publishes draft release on desktop-version.json bump). First real build = CI after merge.~~ (2026-06-10)
- **Original design notes (kept for the picker follow-up):** the IFC worker is assembled by stringifying the SAME shared functions the main-thread fallback uses (`_getIFCWorkerUrl`, index.html:~3075) — so the scope filter goes into the shared stream-processing function once and both paths get it. Plan: (1) fast pre-pass already exists (`loadIFCMetadataOnly` ~13451 + `extractStoreys`) → storey list before geometry; (2) UI: storey-picker step in the load flow (reuse Levels-panel rendering) with "Load all" default so the flow stays one-click; (3) thread `scope:{storeys:[...]}` through loadIFCWorker message + loadIFC signature; in the StreamAllMeshes callback, `continue` for elements whose storeyMap entry is out of scope (storeyMap is built BEFORE geometry streaming); (4) un-loaded storeys listed in Levels panel greyed with a "load now" affordance → re-parse with widened scope (file bytes are in IDB via idbSaveFile). Memory + time win proportional to scope; geo-cache keying must include the scope or only cache full loads (simpler: only cache full loads, v1).
- **Then Tauri Phase 0** per TAURI.md (user-approved order).
Fourth batch (2026-06-10) — spike fix + loading status correction:  **[STALE?]**

- ~~**Spikey-model-on-refresh ROOT CAUSE found and fixed (#598):** geo-cache hash-fallback `_instKey` hashes bbox-NORMALIZED qpos bytes — scale-invariant, so same-proportion different-size shapes (12 m vs 18 m piles) hash identically → wrong instancing groups. Fix: absolute mm-rounded bbox appended to key + `_geoExpId` stashed on restore. The five 5.19.29-48 hotfixes couldn't work — the bytes carry no scale.~~ (2026-06-10)
- **In-browser IFC loading status (corrects earlier open-points list):** worker parsing ALREADY EXISTS (`loadIFCWorker`, primary path at the load call site) and WASM model cleanup is correct. IFC 4.3 (IFC4X3_ADD2) PARSES WITH GEOMETRY under pinned web-ifc 0.0.77 (Node-verified) — claimed in llms.txt. Remaining real item: storey/discipline-scoped loading (big; next session, before Tauri Phase 0).
- **Stale-branch audit:** all 24 non-main remote branches' content is in main (squash-merged), superseded (geoplace-persist → modelMeta georef; threejs-r179-bump → #595), or deliberately reverted (Free-RAM family). Nothing to merge. Safe to bulk-delete for hygiene.

Third batch same branch (2026-06-10) — cross-repo contract audit (user-supplied PAT, since deleted) + addon one-click UX:  **[STALE?]**

- ~~**ClashControlEngine audit** → two real bugs fixed both sides: GET /update sends {latest,release_url} but addon read {update_version,update_url} AND the addon's /update handler never dispatched the info into state → update banner always blank. Addon now accepts both shapes + dispatches (main repo); engine adds aliases + modelAId/modelBId on clash objects (O(1) resolve) — ClashControlEngine PR #24 (draft; merge to main auto-releases).~~ (2026-06-10)
- ~~**ClashControlConnector audit**: protocol contract SOLID — version 1.0 both sides with semver handshake, all 22 message types handled bidirectionally, 14/16 items of its CLASHCONTROL_INTEGRATION_IMPROVEMENTS.md wishlist already implemented. Only note: browser sends `modelFilter` in export, plugin parses but ignores it (future scoped re-export).~~ (2026-06-10)
- ~~**ClashControlSmartBridge repo is superseded** (stopped at 0.2.3; bridge lives in main repo as 0.3.x and the app downloads from main-repo releases). Deprecation-banner PR #14 opened; recommend archiving the repo after merge.~~ (2026-06-10)
- ~~**Addon one-click UX**: new `alwaysOn` addon flag (forces active; Addons panel shows "Built in · always on" instead of a do-nothing toggle). Applied to align/splat/visibility (were registered but never auto-activated — features sat behind a dead Settings toggle) and to newly-registered data-quality/accessibility/training-data (were invisible in the panel). External-dep addons keep real toggles + their existing one-click connect flows.~~ (2026-06-10)

On branch `claude/jolly-cannon-YZUwi-followup` (2026-06-08) — Splat addon Phase 1 + Three.js bump scheduled:  **[STALE?]**

- **`addons/splat.js` (Phase 1, sibling-canvas pattern):** opt-in addon that lazy-loads Three.js r180 + Spark.js 2.0 as ESM only when the user actually loads a splat. Mounts its own WebGL canvas BEHIND the main IFC canvas (z-index 0, pointer-events:none), mirrors the core's camera each frame via `_ccViewport.getCamera()` and a new `cc-render-frame` event the core fires after every render. IFC canvas clear-color forced transparent while splats are active; restored on unload. **Core stays on r128.** Drag-drop wired for `.splat / .ksplat / .spz` (alongside `.ply / .pcd` for point clouds). Public API: `_ccLoadSplat(urlOrFile, opts)`, `_ccUnloadSplats(id?)`, `_ccListSplats()`, `_ccTestSplat()` (loads a public sample for the spike).
- **Architecture decision (matters):** addons can bring their own modern Three.js. Core Three.js doesn't need to bump just to ship modern-Three features. The splat addon is the proof-of-concept; future modern-Three addons follow the same pattern until the bundle math turns against us (3-4 such addons each pulling 600KB).
- **Three.js core bump SCHEDULED, not done.** Trigger condition: WebGPU compute path for clash detection, expected ~10× speedup on 10k+ element federations. Plan in session transcript: 4 days bump (r128 → r179, ESM via import maps, no build step, ~514 THREE refs to migrate, ~6 CDN script loads to convert) + 1 week WebGPU clash path with WebGL2 fallback + 3 days re-verification = ~2 weeks. Risks: rendered-mode material defaults, TransformControls API change, InstancedMesh raycast quirks. Workarounds we'd retire: chunk-merge Stage 2A outline (~200 lines), hand-rolled selection outline (~150 lines), hand-written BufferGeometry merge (~80 lines), raycast fallback for moved instances (~50). Workarounds we'd keep: chunk-merge Stage 1 spatial bucketing (different problem), stencil section hatch.
- **Splat Phase 2 (not yet):** 3D Tiles tileset.json streaming via NASA-AMMOS/3DTilesRendererJS (~r167+ required, Spark plugin available), Esri Site Scan tileset URLs (BYO ArcGIS access token), proj4js for IFC4-georef'd auto-placement.
- **Not browser-tested in this session — main script parses via `new Function(body)`; addon parses via `node --check`. Spike validation = the user opening Vercel preview, dragging a public SPZ sample (or calling `window._ccTestSplat()` in console), and confirming the camera-sync feels right at IFC scales.**

On branch `claude/jolly-cannon-YZUwi-followup` (2026-06-08) — BCF provenance round-trip, autonomy envelope UI, viewer fixes:  **[STALE?]**

- **BCF round-trip of `aiProvenance`** (`exportBCF` + `importBCF`): writes `cc:aiModel`, `cc:aiSource`, `cc:aiAt` as `<Labels>` on every topic that has aiProvenance set. Same proven pattern as `cc:revitA`/`cc:revitB`. Importer reconstructs aiProvenance on the issue payload (`source:'bcf_import'`); existing "AI" chip in IssueRow renders unchanged.
- **Autonomy envelope UI** in SettingsModal "AI / Natural Language" section: segmented Nudge | Suggest control on `s.prefs.aiEnvelope.resolveClashes` (the state field shipped in #589). Default Nudge. `auto` mode stays reserved.
- **Viewer fixes** (single commit): (1) section box + measure now coexist — `clearAllModes` accepts an optional `{sectionBox|measureMode:true}` keep set so the two tools don't cancel each other (other modes still mutually exclusive); (2) section-plane drag arrow + section-box face arrows changed `0x1a6b4a` (brand green) → `0xf59e0b` (amber) to match the rotation ring and read as one gizmo; opacity bumped 0.65 → 0.85; (3) wheel zoom no longer dead-stops at `sph.r=0.5` floor — when radius would clamp, target advances along view direction by the requested delta instead (Blender/Rhino "drive forward" pattern), so detail inspection works at any scale. PR #591.

On branch `claude/screenshot-clashcontrol-review-tiHAk` (2026-06-08) — Tiered AI (Groq basic + own-LLM Connector) + IFC-viewer/Solibri SEO:  **[STALE?]**

- **Bridge simplified to zero-key:** dropped the API-key cloud presets I'd briefly added. Built-in chat now offers only one-click local autodetect (Ollama/LM Studio/llama.cpp/Jan) + the existing "Configure Claude" (Claude Desktop app, no key). Rationale: user said API keys are "outdated and too difficult."
- **`/api/nl` is now Groq-ONLY** (`api/nl.js`): Gemma/Gemini fallback chain **removed** (user: "drop Gemma"). POST Groq `/openai/v1/chat/completions` with `TOOLS` mapped to OpenAI `tools` format, parse `tool_calls` → identical `{intent,...params}` contract. Default `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` (`GROQ_MODEL` overridable). On 429/down → 503/429 → client uses offline regex. `GEMINI_API_KEY` still used by `/api/title` + `/api/triage` only. Verified: success→intent, 429→quota_exceeded, no-key→503 (mocked-fetch handler tests). **User must set `GROQ_API_KEY` in Vercel.**
- **Tiered AI / nudge in Ask AI** (`index.html`): the built-in assistant (Groq) is deliberately BASIC. When a command matches resolution-verb + clash-noun (`_solveRx`+`_aboutClash`), it routes to the user's own LLM via the Connector (`127.0.0.1:19803/chat`) if connected, else shows a one-click-connect **nudge** (warm-up → bring-your-own-LLM / future paid tier). Also: on server failure, the `.catch` falls back to the connected own-LLM; over-quota message points to the Connector. Regex validated on 9 cases (find/show clashes = basic; resolve/fix clash = nudge).
- **SEO** (`index.html` head, `manifest.json`, `README.md`, `llms.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, new `free-solibri-alternative/index.html`): lead with "online IFC viewer", position as free Solibri/Navisworks alternative; added homepage `FAQPage` schema (Google rich results + LLM answer engines), `alternateName`/`keywords`/fuller `featureList` on `SoftwareApplication`.
- **Verify on Vercel preview** (not browser-tested here): main inline script parses; `api/nl.js` Groq path unit-tested with mocked fetch; JSON-LD blocks validated.

On branch `claude/screenshot-clashcontrol-review-tiHAk` (2026-06-07) — Smart Bridge: one-click "use your own AI":  **[STALE?]**

- **Why:** the BYO-LLM agent loop already existed (`smart-bridge-server.js` `runAgentLoop` → any OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` + `tool_calls` → `callBrowser` → `window._ccDispatch`), but was buried behind a 3-option dropdown with an empty `baseUrl` nobody knew how to fill. Goal: one click to connect the LLM the user already runs **on their desktop**. Local-desktop *requires* the bridge by design — the https app can't reach `http://localhost:11434` (mixed-content/CORS), so the native bridge proxies localhost. (Zero-install + local-desktop are mutually exclusive; user chose local-desktop.)
- **Server (`smart-bridge-server.js`):** new `GET /llm/autodetect` probes `LOCAL_LLM_CANDIDATES` (Ollama :11434, LM Studio :1234, llama.cpp :8080, Jan :1337) in parallel via existing `probeLlm({baseUrl})`, returns `{found:[{provider,label,baseUrl,models}]}`. `bridge-version.json` 0.2.0→0.3.0. Verified end-to-end against a stub LLM (boots with a tiny `ws` stub since `ws` isn't installed here).
- **Addon (`addons/smart-bridge.js`):** primary "Connect my desktop LLM" button → `/llm/autodetect` → auto-fills + saves config (`_detectLocal`); 404 → falls back to manual presets (older Connector). Presets expanded: local (Ollama/LM Studio/llama.cpp/Jan, no key) + cloud (OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini`, Claude `claude-sonnet-4-5` via Anthropic's OpenAI-compat, key). Copy reframed "Use your own AI"; "Get a key" links + Claude-compat-beta note.
- **Note / out of scope:** cloud keys (Claude/OpenAI) don't *strictly* need the bridge — they live in the bridge panel for now; moving them to the no-bridge in-app NL bar is Tier-2. The root-relative URL bug (`new URL('/v1/chat/completions', baseUrl)` drops path prefixes → breaks Groq/OpenRouter/Gemini) is untouched; in-scope targets resolve correctly. Autodetect reaches users only on the next Connector release; addon degrades gracefully.

On branch `claude/screenshot-clashcontrol-review-tiHAk` (2026-06-07) — Accessibility (toegankelijkheid) geometric check — first building-code geometric layer:  **[STALE?]**

- **Engine: `addons/accessibility.js`** (follows data-quality.js — globals only, no register/toggle; added to `_loadAddonScripts` list). Exposes `window._ccRunAccessibilityChecks(elements, {thresholds})`. Deterministic, no LLM. Checks: door clear width, threshold height, ramp slope, corridor/escape-route width, turning clearance. Method is tiered honestly: ramp slope (bbox rise/run) + door width (IFC quantity, bbox fallback) + threshold (data-gated, n/a when absent) are exact; corridor/turning use footprint minor dimension (approximate for non-rectangular — true medial-axis / inscribed-circle deferred to v2). Every result carries `value/required/pass/unit/note/basis`. NL Bbl/NEN defaults (0.85/1.20/1.50/0.02 m, 1:12). `_ccAccessibilityClearance` wraps `_ccWasmMinDist` for a future element-to-element clearance check (the only check the min-distance kernel actually fits — the v1 dimensional checks are single-element/free-space, so the proposal's "reuse the kernel for everything" was oversold).
- **Panel: `AccessibilityPanel`** in `index.html` (before `DataQualityPanel`), DESIGN tokens. Reachable via Review-workspace toolbar button (`k:'a11y'`) + left-panel tab `'accessibility'` (added to `TITLES` + render switch). Model selector, Run, per-check pass/fail with measured vs required + caveat, "Isolate failing" (ghostOthers), "Create issues".
- **Failure rail = issues, NOT the clash MERGE path.** Routing through `MERGE_CLASHES` would auto-resolve all real clashes (it treats its payload as *the* detection result). So failures dispatch `A.ADD_ISSUE` (`source:'accessibility'`, `qualityGids`), exactly like data-quality → Issues tab + BCF export. If items are wanted literally in the Conflicts/Clashes tab, that needs a new non-destructive `ADD_CLASH` action (follow-up).
- **Not done:** thresholds UI (defaults only, engine accepts overrides); true free-space corridor/turning geometry (v2); the clearance-kernel check. Not browser-tested in env — main script parses via `node --check`; verify on the Vercel preview.
  - ~~The `ADD_CLASH` follow-up above shipped as `A.ADD_CLASHES` (non-destructive, additive — reducer case `index.html:1346`, dispatched by the accessibility panel).~~ (2026-07-08, confirmed by audit)

On branch `claude/screenshot-clashcontrol-review-tiHAk` (2026-06-07) — repo docs refresh: corrected clash-engine description (AABB+BVH, not OBB), green brand accent in DESIGN.md, web-ifc 0.0.77, added geoplace/pointcloud addons + tile/triage APIs to CLAUDE.md, marked instancing/BVH-cache as implemented in PERFORMANCE_NOTES, archived 185 lines of completed [STALE?] MEMORY blocks. Docs state current facts only (no change-history phrasing).

On branch `claude/screenshot-clashcontrol-review-tiHAk` (2026-06-07) — IFC4 georeferencing read + placement-sanity (context/QA, NOT a clash-accuracy feature):  **[STALE?]**

- **Framing (deliberate):** clash detection is relative geometry and does not depend on geolocation. A geolocation/base-point mismatch between models shows up as gross systematic noise (everything off by one vector) — a coordination symptom, not a design conflict. So this work is positioned as *context + pre-run QA*, not "georef makes clashes trustworthy". The clash engine still runs in local coordinates; nothing here touches the geometry/clash math.
- **Extraction (`extractSpatialHierarchy`, `index.html:~2049`):** added `IFCMAPCONVERSION:1709695098` + `IFCPROJECTEDCRS:3843373140` constants and read the IFC4 georef chain into `hierarchy.mapConversion = {eastings, northings, orthogonalHeight, rotationDeg, scale, epsg}`. `rotationDeg = atan2(XAxisOrdinate, XAxisAbscissa)` (grid rotation); `epsg` from `TargetCRS.Name`. Pure read, wrapped in try/catch — no behaviour change when absent. (The older `IfcSite` lat/lon path is unchanged.)
- **Display (Geo Placement panel, `index.html:~14250`):** read-only mono line showing EPSG · grid rotation · E/N offset when any loaded model has a `mapConversion`. Tooltip states it's context only, not used by the clash engine.
- **Placement-sanity (`window._ccPlacementWarnings(models)` + RunDetectionModal banner, `index.html:~15605`):** on modal open, compares per-model world bboxes (`_ccState3d.map[id]` via `setFromObject`, same precedent as geoplace `_getModelBBox`). Warns when two models declare different EPSG, or sit >8× the larger diagonal apart and don't overlap ("a clash run between them will find nothing"). Capped at 4 warnings. Non-blocking amber banner.
- **NOT done (deliberately deferred):** proj4js / projected→WGS84 reprojection for an accurate basemap (still the `geoplace.js:4` deferral); auto-aligning federated models by map conversion; feeding `rotationDeg` into the basemap auto-rotation (sign convention not verified — kept display-only to avoid shipping a wrong rotation).
- **Caveats:** not browser-tested this session (no GPU/sample IFC) — syntax-checked only (main inline script parses via `node --check`). `setFromObject` instance/chunk bounding follows the existing geoplace precedent. Rotation sign/zero-meridian conventions are display-only and unverified against a real georeferenced IFC.

On branch `claude/jolly-planck-mgEaf` (2026-06-06) — Phase C: cluster cards as rows + keyboard triage:  **[STALE?]**

- Cluster headers (Grouped mode, clash tab) upgraded to **Sentry/Linear-style cluster cards** with: severity dot on the left edge (colour from max `aiSeverity`/`type` across the cluster), 2-line layout (title + chips row), storey chip, **model-pair chip** (highlighted when cross-model so N-model federations make the owner obvious at a glance), open/resolved counts. Hover reveals two action buttons: **Triage** (calls `window._ccTriageCluster(items)`) and **Resolve all** (confirm dialog, then `_ccResolveCluster`).
- New abstractions: `window._ccTriageCluster(clashes)` (today: copy AI prompt to clipboard with toast; Week 3 swaps for `fetch('/api/triage')` — UI doesn't change), `window._ccResolveCluster(clashes, dispatch)` (loops `UPD_CLASH` resolved), `window._ccClusterSeverity(items)` (rank table).
- Keyboard shortcuts in `VirtualList` (clash tab only): **J/K** next/prev item (aliases for ArrowDown/Up), **T** triage current group, **R** resolve all open in current group (confirm prompt), **X** expand/collapse current group, **/** focus the search input. Existing Arrow/Tab/Esc unchanged.
- Non-cluster grouping (storey/severity/discipline/etc.) keeps the original lean header — only cluster groups get the card treatment.

On branch `claude/jolly-planck-mgEaf` (2026-06-06) — Phase A2: N-model scope picker (All / discipline / model)  **[STALE?]**

- New `_renderScopePicker(rules, models, d)` replaces the legacy "Check / against" rows in `ClashRulesPanel`. Segmented control: **All ↔ All / By discipline / By model**. Side A / Side B multi-pickers reuse `_modelMultiPicker`. Pair-count badge shows live "N model(s) loaded · ~K pairs" when narrowed.
- New `rules.scopeMode` field is the UI hint; `rules.modelA` / `modelB` stay as engine truth. `_ccDerivedScopeMode(rules)` derives mode from existing modelA/modelB on first render so saved presets and shared `.ccproject` files keep working unchanged.
- `_ccSummariseRules` rendered with array-aware label list (e.g. "structural + mep ↔ architectural").
- Self-clash control unchanged in this commit — the existing `_selfClashPicker` already handles N models via multi-select. Deferred consolidation into a single Off/On-all/On-selected control.

On branch `claude/jolly-planck-mgEaf` (2026-06-06) — Phase B: clashes panel header cleanup + grouped-by-default:  **[STALE?]**

- The 9-option Group dropdown is replaced (clash tab only) with a 2-button **Grouped | All** segmented control. Grouped = the Week-1 cluster de-dupe; All = flat list. A small secondary "by [storey/severity/discipline/…]" select appears only in All mode for the other axes.
- After `A.MERGE_CLASHES`, `s.clashGroupBy` is seeded to `['cluster']` if the user has never explicitly picked a Group option (`localStorage` flag `cc_clashGroupBy`). First-time visceral demo: 400 raw clashes appear as ~15 cluster cards by default.
- `ClashAISummary` defaults to collapsed (`useState(true)`). One-line header strip stays visible; details expand on click.
- Issue tab keeps its original Group dropdown (Phase B is clash-only).
- Copy AI prompt button (Week 2) is now visible on every cluster header by default — no extra clicks needed to reach the AI triage prompt copy.

On branch `claude/jolly-planck-mgEaf` (2026-06-06) — Phase A: Run Detection modal (UI overhaul step 1):  **[STALE?]**

- New toolbar **Run detection** button (accent CTA in the TopToolbar's section/measure gap) opens a new `RunDetectionModal` (`index.html:~14894`) that wraps the existing `ClashRulesPanel` (Quick Run presets + Advanced) plus a collapsible **Project standards** section embedding `StandardsPanel`. One surface for all clash setup.
- New `_ccSummariseRules(rules, models)` helper produces a one-line header (e.g. `Hard clashes · 6 models, all-vs-all`) shown under the modal title.
- New state field `s.runModalOpen`, action `A.SHOW_RUN_MODAL`. `A.DETECTING` auto-closes the modal on run.
- Removed **Detection Rules** tab from the IssuePanel tab bar (`~15336`). StandardsPanel is still rendered defensively if `s.tab==='standards'` ever fires, but no UI path sets it now. Cmd-K palette "Open Standards" and the NL "double-cancel" fallback both redirect to `A.SHOW_RUN_MODAL` instead.
- Engine selector pill in toolbar stays (power-user shortcut); inside the modal the engine selector inside ClashRulesPanel also stays.
- Not done in this commit: N-model scope picker (`rules.scope = { mode, sideA, sideB }`) and self-clash consolidation. The legacy `modelA`/`modelB` multi-picker still works for all N models, just less intuitive than the planned segmented control. Phase A2 next.
- Caveats: untested in browser this session (no GPU/sample IFC); syntax-checked only via `new Function(body)`. The summary line shows `modelA ↔ modelB` for non-all rules but does not yet enumerate when `modelA`/`modelB` are arrays (`_modelSelectLabel` only handles scalar input). Cosmetic — not wrong.

On branch `claude/jolly-planck-mgEaf` (2026-06-05) — AI Triage Weeks 1+2: clustering + prompt scaffolding (still no API call):  **[STALE?]**

**Week 2 — context-packet + prompt, manual copy-paste loop.** New `window._ccBuildClusterContext(clashes)` walks the cluster, looks up each element via `_ccElementFor(modelId, expressId)` (uses `window._ccLatestState`), and returns a JSON-ready context: ifcType / name / objectType / storey / material / curated quantities (Length, Diameter, Volume, etc.), cross-model + same-storey flags, hard/soft/duplicate counts, spatial extent + center in metres, min/max distance. `window._ccBuildTriagePrompt(ctx)` produces a senior-BIM-coordinator prompt asking for `{title, severity, explanation, discipline_conflict, false_positive_likelihood, resolution_options[]}` — advisory framing, no prescriptive structural changes. New "Copy AI prompt" button on each cluster group header (only when groupBy='cluster' and clash tab) copies the full prompt to clipboard so we can iterate against Claude/Gemma manually before wiring `/api/triage` in Week 3.



- New `Group → Smart group (de-dupe)` option in the Clashes panel. Collapses N raw clashes from the same element pair (e.g. same pipe through the same beam emitted at 30 sample points) into one expandable group. Pure code, no API call. First step toward the AI Triage tier (Steps 2–4 add LLM explanation, severity, resolution options, BCF write-back).
- Implementation: `window._ccClusterKeyFor(c)` = sorted pair of `(globalIdA||eid, globalIdB||eid)` — model-prefixed when GUID missing — so same pair clusters across reversed A/B order. `window._ccClusterLabelFor(c)` = `typeA × typeB — nameA ↔ nameB` (truncated 22 chars). Key/label decoupled via `window._ccClusterDisplay` side-map so the group header shows the readable label, not the GUID hash.
- New `'cluster'` case in `_groupKeyFor` (`index.html:~17288`) populates the display map and returns the hash key for grouping. Group header lookup at `index.html:~17545`.
- Added option to the Group dropdown for the Clashes tab only (`index.html:~15583`). Issues dropdown unchanged.
- Caveats: cluster cache (`_ccClusterDisplay`) accumulates labels across detection runs — harmless (deterministic from clash data) but not GC'd; rebuild on `LOAD_MODEL` if it ever shows stale text. No spatial bucketing — same long duct hitting the same beam at two physically distinct spots will collapse to one group (rare; acceptable for v1).
- Not done: visual count badge ("400 → 14") in the toolbar (the per-group count badge is already shown by VirtualList); fly-to that frames all clashes in a cluster; "Triage this group" button (Week 3); BCF write-back of group structure.

On branch `claude/adoring-hopper-IEpvn` (2026-06-03) — SEO Phase 0+1+2 (canonical, crawlability, landing pages):  **[STALE?]**

- Add `<link rel="canonical">`, `<noscript>` body content, visually-hidden `<h1>`, `SoftwareApplication` JSON-LD, `og:locale` to `index.html` head.
- Add `vercel.json` 301 redirects for `/clash-control`, `/ClashControl`, `/index.html` → `/`.
- Add `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, `llms.txt` at repo root.
- Phase 2: shipped 5 use-case static pages (`/free-navisworks-alternative`, `/ifc-clash-detection-online`, `/free-bcf-viewer`, `/free-ifc-viewer-online`, `/ids-validation-online`) with `FAQPage` JSON-LD, cross-links, and Goatcounter CTA tagging. Sitemap + `llms.txt` updated.
- Phase 3 remaining: submit sitemap in Google Search Console (needs owner access).

On branch `claude/meshlets-research-OSMAL` (2026-05-30) — "can we use meshlets?" research + Stage-1 PoC:  **[STALE?]**

- Researched meshlets/mesh shaders. Verdict: hardware mesh shaders don't exist in WebGL/WebGPU; Needle/Nanite-style GPU meshlet rasterizers need WebGPU + three.js r160+ (too big a lift for this r128/no-build app). Meshlets do **not** help clash detection (the BVH already uses 4-tri leaves, finer than meshlets). The real, in-stack win is the *spirit* of meshlets: merge the 5k–200k per-material meshes into spatially-clustered chunks to slash draw calls + the per-mesh cull loop.
- Implemented a **flag-gated Stage-1 PoC** (`window._ccChunkMerge`, default OFF → exact revert). New `_ccBuildMergedChunks`/`_ccMergeChunkGeometries` near `_buildInstancedMeshes` (`index.html:~2200`), hooked after both IFC instancing call sites. Buckets non-instanced static meshes by spatial grid cell × material, ≤65 535-vert budget, hand-written typed-array merge (BufferGeometryUtils isn't loaded). Mutates only the render list; `element.meshes[]` untouched (protects clash/serialize/bounds — the instancing precedent).
- Picking preserved via per-chunk faceIndex→expressId range table (`window._ccChunkExprIdForFace`, used in `_hitExpressId`). Culling extended for `_isMergedChunk` (`updateCulling`). Section-clip traversals (×3) broadened so chunk/instanced materials still receive clipping planes. Hover highlight suppressed on chunks. Identity features (highlight outline / ghost / color-by-class / hide) naturally no-op on chunks under the flag (deferred to Stage 2 shader-LUT).
- **Not done / caveats:** runtime browser verification (no GPU/sample IFC in this env — syntax-checked only via vm.Script); GLB + geo-cache-restore paths not hooked (fresh IFC loads only); transparent meshes merged into a chunk may sort imprecisely; merge trades away geoCache VRAM dedup (measure `renderer.info.memory.geometries`). Plan: `/root/.claude/plans/can-we-use-the-sprightly-waffle.md`.
- **Stage 1 verified by user (2026-06-04): orbiting large models is "very smooth" now.** Merged via PR #561.  **[STALE?]**
- **Stage 2A — selection & isolation on merged chunks, NO shaders (proxy/split-out reuse). Merged via PR #566; user: "works amazing".** `_findMeshByRef` falls back to the off-scene per-element proxy (`element.meshes[0]`) via a new per-model index `_ccProxyElement`/`_ccProxyMeshFor` → selection EdgesGeometry outline works. `ghostOthers` ghosts whole chunks then re-surfaces kept elements as full-material proxy clones (`_keptProxy`), removed in `unghostAll`. Post-process outline guarded to in-scene meshes only. Skips instanced (`_instanceRef`) to avoid double-render.
- **Stage 2B — bulk hide + color on chunks, in-place (no shaders, no unmerge); flips `window._ccChunkMerge` default → ON.** Render-style already applied to chunks (meshList = all meshes). **Hide** (class/storey/temp/isolate): `window._ccChunkApplyHidden` rebuilds each chunk's index to drop hidden elements' triangles, unioning a `window._ccHiddenReg` {class,storey,temp} registry that the 3 hide effects populate; picking stays correct via a parallel `_activeRanges` table (`_ccChunkExprIdForFace` prefers it); `_fullIndex` preserves the original for restore. **Color** (color-by-class + DQ `colorByDistribution`/`colorByILSDist`): `window._ccChunkApplyColors(map)` writes a per-vertex RGB `color` attr (matched→class/DQ color, unmatched→opaque context gray — all-opaque to dodge depth-sort artifacts) and swaps the chunk to one shared `vertexColors` material (`_ccColored`); render-style loop skips `_ccColored` chunks; `_ccChunkClearColors` restores. Default flip = one-line revert (`window._ccChunkMerge=false`).
- **Stage 2B caveats / long tail NOT yet chunk-aware (default is now ON, so these silently no-op on merged chunks until swept):** BCF viewpoint per-element visibility, search-highlight, validation-failure highlight, and any other of the ~15 visibility / ~34 color setters that traverse by `expressId`. Edge: changing render-style *while* color-by-class is active leaves chunks one style behind until color is cleared. Not runtime-tested in this env (syntax-checked only).

On branch `claude/code-review-quality-IjbhT` (2026-05-28) — code-review quality pass:  **[STALE?]**

- ~~`api/title.js`: `MAX_CLASHES` was 50 but the handler then sliced to 20, silently dropping clashes 21–50. Set the cap to 20 (matches the client's per-call batch in `index.html:~22662` and the documented contract) and slice with the constant, so oversized payloads get a clear 413.~~ (2026-05-28)
- ~~Addon convention: `pwa.js`, `shared-project.js`, `local-engine.js`, `revit-bridge.js` called `window._ccRegisterAddon(...)` unguarded. Wrapped each in a `typeof === 'function'` guard (one-liner, no re-indent) matching `wasm-engine.js`.~~ (2026-05-28)
- ~~`addons/training-data.js`: extracted the 3×-duplicated Google-Forms submit-with-fallback (CORS → no-cors → hidden iframe) into one `_postToGoogleForm(entryId, value, onStatus, onSuccess)` helper. AI share passes `null` for onSuccess (it intentionally does not clear the store).~~ (2026-05-28)
- ~~Error handling: `suggestOmniClass` provider chains now reject on non-ok HTTP via `_aiResJson` (NOTE: `suggestOmniClass` is currently dead code — defined, never called); `/api/health` guards `r.ok` before `.json()`; `api/nl.js` upstream-error log truncated to 500 chars.~~ (2026-05-28)
- ~~Docs: CLAUDE.md core line count 19.8k → ~29k, added `smart-bridge.js` + `wasm-engine.js` to the file overview and "what each addon does". MEMORY.md version header 4.15.4 → 5.12.6. Taught `scripts/update-memory.py` to keep the Project State `**Version:**` line synced from `version.json` on every daily run.~~ (2026-05-28)
- ~~Testing/CI: added a no-dependency `node:test` suite under `tests/` (CORS allow-list + rate limiter in `_lib.js`; title/nl validation incl. the 413 regression lock), `"test": "node --test"` script, and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` running it on PRs/pushes to main. Added `.gitignore` (none existed).~~ (2026-05-28)

**Deferred (tracked follow-ups, not done this pass):** core reducer/state refactor (287-line reducer / 80+ cases / impure `_saveDeniedClash` inside the reducer / ~50 `window._cc*` globals) — do it only once the test suite covers the pure clash/reducer/BCF logic, which needs those helpers extracted from `index.html` first. Also: a CI check that re-verifies `index.html` SRI hashes against the live CDN, and 3D-canvas keyboard accessibility (no keyboard orbit/pan, no modal focus trap).

**P6.2-continued real-browser verification, deterministic dispose() check (2026-07-22, branch  **[STALE?]**
`claude/clashcontrol-v7-p6-2-continued`)** — after PR #705 merged (P6.2 slice 2:
`_ccElementWorldBox`/`center()` migration), evaluated further candidates against the user's
explicit rule ("small risk high reward → do it; high risk medium reward or less → skip") and
concluded neither `_geoSerialize` migration (real risk of silent geo-cache corruption, hygiene-
only reward) nor `storageDetectCaches` graduation (Safari/Firefox-only cap logic, unverifiable —
no Firefox/WebKit binary in this env, only `chromium`/`chromium-1194`/`chromium_headless_shell`
under `/opt/pw-browsers/`) clears that bar. Instead extended `tests/browser/memory-park-restore.mjs`
with a **deterministic, non-GC-noise-dependent check**: read `renderer.info.memory.geometries`
(Three.js's own live-buffer bookkeeping) before/after parking model B, and independently count
model B's own distinct scene geometries via `S.map[modelBId].traverse(...)` (per-model
`THREE.Group`, confirmed `userData.modelId` lives on the group not per-mesh). Ran for real in
Chromium (`CC_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE=/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome`, 2 synthetic
models, 10,200 elements total). **Result: model B owns exactly 1 live geometry (its
elements are batched/instanced under the hood), and `rendererGeometries` drops by exactly 1 on
park — `dropMatchesModelBGeometryCount: true`.** This is a clean, GC-timing-independent
confirmation that Park's `dispose()` step frees exactly what it owns, no more/no less — not
just "heap went down eventually" (the earlier noisy finding). The noisy heap/RSS numbers from
the same run stay consistent with prior findings: ledger estimate 14.5MB vs observed heap drop
only 0.3MB and RSS actually +4.8MB immediately after park (GC hasn't run yet at that sample
point) — expected and already-documented ledger/observed-delta mismatch, not a regression.
Repeated park↔restore (3 cycles) stays flat (~330MB parked, ~330MB restored, no compounding
climb); repeated detection (6 runs) nets -44MB not positive growth. Full `node --test` suite
still 777/777 green. Committed (`c92533a`) and pushed to the correct designated branch
`claude/clashcontrol-v7-release-plan-jp5njw` (the prior branch, `claude/clashcontrol-v7-p6-2-
continued`, already had PR #705 merged from it — per CLAUDE.md's fresh-branch-after-merge
convention, cherry-picked the one still-unmerged commit from it, `feat(nl-commands): use
el.expressId directly`, onto the designated branch before continuing).

**Production-scale re-test + RSS/first-restore investigation, same day** — user confirmed doing
all three proposed follow-ups. Scaled `memory-park-restore.mjs`'s synthetic fixtures from
~10.2k to **~31k total elements** (5x200 + 30x1000 walls), matching the user's real-world
federation scale; bumped `waitForFunction` timeouts (120s/60s → 400s/180s) for the larger load.
Re-ran for real in Chromium — the P6.2-continued deterministic dispose() finding holds
**unchanged at scale**: model B still owns exactly 1 live geometry (batched), and
`renderer.info.memory.geometries` still drops by exactly 1 on park
(`dropMatchesModelBGeometryCount: true`). Added two new instrumented findings:
- **Boot RSS baseline split**: engine-only (bare single-process Chromium+SwiftShader before any
  page nav) = 148MB; app-boot RSS (page loaded, WASM/React/addons initialized, no model) = 380MB
  → the app's own boot cost is ~232MB, not the full ~390MB the earlier pass implied was all
  "baseline". Worth knowing the split for anyone trying to shrink the floor.
- **First-restore heap-growth attribution**: caught and fixed a self-introduced bug first (the
  "before restore" sample was accidentally captured AFTER the restore call, comparing
  restored-vs-restored and showing a false 0MB growth — moved the capture above the restore
  call). Real numbers: first restore costs **+283MB** heap, while `renderer.info` stays almost
  flat (geometries 15→16, programs 10→10 unchanged, textures 9→12) — meaning the growth is
  **JS-side** (props/`element.meshes[]`/BVH rehydration for ~30k elements), not GPU/shader
  recompilation. Consistent with Park/Restore's known design (park frees the JS object graph,
  restore rebuilds it from the geoCache).
- **New open question surfaced, not resolved**: the heap plateaus after repeated park↔restore
  cycles at ~617MB — but the ORIGINAL fresh two-model load of the exact same 31k elements only
  used ~158MB. That's a **3.91x** ratio for identical data. Not a leak (cycles 2-3 are flat, no
  further climbing), but restore's rebuild-from-geoCache path appears to retain meaningfully more
  resident JS heap per element than a fresh IFC parse of the same data — recorded as an explicit
  unresolved finding in the test's JSON output rather than silently folded into "no leak found".
  Candidate causes not yet investigated: geoCache deserialization producing less compact typed
  arrays/objects than the fresh-parse path, duplicate BVH builds, or property-graph structures
  not being re-canonicalized identically on restore.

Full `node --test` suite re-confirmed 777/777 after these changes (unrelated to the .mjs-only
edit, but re-run for safety). Committed and pushed to
`claude/clashcontrol-v7-release-plan-jp5njw`.

**Next honest step, not yet started:** investigate the 3.91x restore-vs-fresh-load heap ratio —
likely needs comparing `_geoDeserialize`'s output shapes against the fresh-parse path's output
shapes directly (byte-for-byte), which is a real code-reading task, not just another browser run.

**Root-caused and fixed the 3.91x ratio, same day** — user asked to find and fix the source.
Traced it to a real bug via console-log timing instrumentation in the probe, not just static
reading: `_mergeLazyProps` (`index.html:~4435`) is the callback that runs once a model's async
Phase 2 property extraction (`loadIFCWorker`'s deferred `onProps`, always separate from the
synchronous geometry phase) lands — its job includes patching the model's geoCache with
`hasPsets: true`, the flag `_ccRestoreModelGeometry`'s fast path (`cached.v>=7 && cached.hasPsets`)
requires to skip a full cold IFC re-parse on restore. The bug: `_mergeLazyProps` looked up the
live model in `s.models` first and returned immediately if not found — so a model **parked before
its own Phase 2 landed** (confirmed via console instrumentation: the 30k-element model's
`"[IFC] Lazy-merged psets..."` log never fired before park, only the small model's did) silently
lost `hasPsets` forever, and every future restore fell back to `_ccColdParseParkedEntry`'s full
`loadIFC()` re-parse — permanently, for the rest of that model's session — defeating Park's whole
point for exactly the large/slow-to-process models it should help most. Verified the theory first
(giving the test fixture real psets dropped the ratio to 1.36x, since the FIRST cold-parse's own
`loadIFC()` call resaves the cache with real psets via its own synchronous, non-lazy property
extraction pass — but a genuinely pset-less model, like the raw fixture, can never self-heal that
way). **Fix**: decoupled the geoCache patch from the live in-memory model lookup — it now reads/
writes `cached.elData` directly via `propMap` keyed by `expressId` whenever the live model is
gone, instead of bailing out. Verified on the *exact same* no-psets fixture (no test changes): the
ratio dropped from **3.91x → 1.44x**, and cycle-2+ restore deltas shrank from ~150MB to ~1MB —
direct evidence the fast path is now actually reached. `tests/lazy-props-geocache-patch.test.js`
(5 tests) locks the structural fix in. Full suite 782/782 green. The residual 1.44x is a smaller,
more plausible "known cost of rebuilding ~30k individual JS objects from a cache" gap, not
recorded as fully explained — a genuinely separate, much smaller follow-up if ever revisited.
