# Your Clash Detection Software Costs $5,000 a Year. It Doesn't Have To.

The coordination meeting is in two hours. You need to run a clash check on the updated MEP model. Your Navisworks seat is on a machine in the office. You're working from home. Your colleague has the only other license and they're already in a meeting.

You know what the output of that clash check is going to be. You've run it a hundred times. But the $5,000-a-year software is sitting behind a license wall and a VPN, and now you're going to walk into a coordination meeting with stale results.

This is the daily reality of BIM coordination in 2026. Not a technical problem. A licensing problem.

## Clash detection that lives in a browser tab

[ClashControl](https://www.clashcontrol.io) is a free, open-source IFC clash detection tool. There is no installer. There is no license key. There is no account to create. You open a browser, drag in your IFC files, and start detecting clashes — on any machine, anywhere, right now.

Load multiple IFC models simultaneously. Set up clash rules: architecture versus MEP, structure versus MEP, hard clashes for actual intersections, soft clashes for clearance violations with a distance you define. Hit Run. In 5–30 seconds, depending on model size, you have a full clash list, prioritised and ready to review.

That's it. That's the whole barrier to entry: having a browser.

## What the review actually looks like

Every clash in the list has an AI-generated plain-English title. Not "CLASH_0047." Something like: *"Supply duct intersects primary structural beam — Level 3, Grid B4."* You click it, the 3D camera flies to the conflict, and the two offending elements are highlighted in their discipline colors — MEP in red, structural in blue, architectural in purple.

From there you can inspect every IFC property on both elements, assign a status (New / Active / Resolved / Waived), set priority, assign it to the right discipline lead, and add notes. The AI classifier has already flagged the likely false positives so you're not manually reviewing every near-miss in a dense ceiling plenum.

If you'd rather just ask a question: type *"how many unresolved critical clashes are on Level 2?"* into the chat. ClashControl understands plain English. No filter menus, no query syntax.

## Walk through it. Print it out.

Two features in v4.14 close gaps that used to require separate tools.

**Walk mode** drops you into first-person navigation at eye height. Move through a mechanical room to see whether that clearance violation is actually a problem in context, or whether the model is just being pessimistic about a pipe that will flex on site. Unit-aware speed, configurable eye height, smooth controls.

**Sheets** generates annotated floor plan cuts at any height you choose. Label elements, set the view depth and cut height, pick a paper size and plot scale, and export as DXF. For the site team that has AutoCAD open and has no interest in loading a 3D model just to see where the clash is.

## BCF out. Revit, BIMcollab, Navisworks back in.

When the review is done, export to BCF 2.1. The clash report carries locations, camera viewpoints, statuses, priorities, assignees, notes, and 3D snapshots — everything packaged in the open standard that every major BIM platform reads.

Your Revit users open it natively. It loads straight into BIMcollab. Navisworks imports it. The workflow is completely interoperable. You're not locked into anything.

## Why it's free

Because the tool exists is not a mystery. The reason *it costs nothing* is.

BIM coordination is already a hard job. Wrangling federated models from three different consultants, each on a different version of a different authoring tool, all working to a coordination protocol that was written in 2019 and hasn't been updated since — there's plenty of legitimate friction in the process.

Licensing fees aren't legitimate friction. They're a tax on doing your job. A two-person architecture studio shouldn't need to budget $15,000 to run three clash checks a month. A freelance coordinator between contracts shouldn't lose tool access when their subscription lapses. A structural engineering student shouldn't need an Autodesk Education license to learn BCF workflows before it expires in May.

ClashControl is MIT-licensed, source on GitHub, no freemium tier, no feature flags behind a paywall. Audit every line. Fork it. Run it locally. It works offline.

If it saves your team money this year, [consider sponsoring the project](https://github.com/sponsors/clashcontrol-io).

## The workflow from zero to BCF export

1. Go to [clashcontrol.io](https://www.clashcontrol.io) — or download `index.html` from GitHub and open it locally
2. Drag in your IFC models (IFC 2x3 and IFC 4 both supported)
3. Set up clash rules in the Detect panel: pick your model pairs, set hard/soft, define clearance distance
4. Hit Run
5. Review the clash list, assign statuses and owners
6. Export BCF 2.1

That's the coordination round-trip. From two IFC files to a BCF report your whole team can work from, in under five minutes, on whatever machine you happen to be using, without touching a license server.

The meeting starts in two hours. You have time.
