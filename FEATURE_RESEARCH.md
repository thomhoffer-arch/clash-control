## IMPLEMENTED — Completed Features

### 1. IDS Validation (Information Delivery Specification) ✅

**Status**: Implemented in v3.4.x

**What was built**: Users can load `.ids` files and validate IFC models against them. IDS validation results appear as clash-like items in the Clashes tab. State management (`idsValidation`), reducer actions (`IDS_SET_RESULTS`, `IDS_SET_SPECS`, `IDS_RUNNING`), and UI are all in place.

**Key references**:
- https://github.com/buildingSMART/IDS (285 stars, the spec itself)
- https://github.com/OpenAEC-Foundation/OpenAEC-BIM-validator (browser-based, similar architecture)

---

### 2. Model Version Diffing (Visual Change Tracking) ✅

**Status**: Implemented in v3.4.x

**What was built**: When re-running clash detection after model changes, `mergeDetectionResults()` compares new clashes against previous results using identity keys. Clashes are tagged with `_delta: 'new'|'persisting'|'auto_resolved'`. The `deltaState` filter lets users view only new, persisting, or auto-resolved clashes. `changeAware` mode tracks element hashes between runs to detect geometry modifications. `lastDeltaSummary` shows counts of new/persisting/auto-resolved after each run.

### 6. Enhanced 2D Markup & Annotation ✅ (partial)

**Status**: Core features implemented in v3.4.x. Export to standalone SVG/PDF not yet done.

**What was built**: DXF and PDF underlay loading, 2D view mode, compare mode, markup tools (line, rect, text, arrow, erase) with color selection. Underlays support positioning, scaling, rotation, opacity, and storey assignment. Markup data is stored in state but not yet persisted across sessions or exportable as standalone files.

**What remains**:
- Markup persistence across sessions (save to localStorage/IndexedDB)
- Markup templates
- Export markups as standalone SVG/PDF

## IMPLEMENT — High-Value Features (Not Yet Built)

### 3. BCF-API Integration (Connected Workflows)

**What**: Add ability to push/pull issues to external BCF servers (BIMcollab, Trimble Connect, OpenProject BIM) via the buildingSMART BCF-API standard, in addition to the existing file-based BCF export.

**Already done**: File-based BCF 2.1 and 3.0 export/import is fully implemented (`exportBCF()`, `importBCF()`). What's missing is the HTTP API integration to push/pull directly to BCF servers without file exchange.

**Why**:
- Turns ClashControl from a standalone tool into a connected one
- Teams already using BCF platforms can integrate ClashControl into their workflow
- Just HTTP fetch calls — no new dependencies, fits single-file architecture
- BCF-API is a well-documented REST standard
- OpenAEC Foundation has a BCF platform as reference

**Key references**:
- https://github.com/buildingSMART/BCF-API (228 stars, the REST spec)
- https://github.com/OpenAEC-Foundation/openaec-bcf-platform

---

### 4. bSDD Property Enrichment

**What**: Add a "Lookup" or "Classify" button in the element inspector that queries the buildingSMART Data Dictionary API to enrich elements with standardized classifications and property definitions.

**Why**:
- Low effort — single API call per element
- Helps users understand what properties should exist on elements
- Improves clash rule accuracy when elements have proper classifications
- Fits single-file architecture perfectly

**Key references**:
- https://github.com/buildingSMART/bSDD (173 stars)
- API docs: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/buildingSMART/Datatool/v3

---

### 5. Rule-Based Model Checking

**What**: Let users define rules beyond geometric clashes — e.g., "all fire doors must have FireRating property", "corridor width >= 1200mm", "structural elements must have material assigned". Check model compliance and report violations as issues.

**Why**:
- Natural extension of the existing Standards tab
- Complements clash detection with data quality checks
- Users already think in terms of rules (the discipline-pair and type-pair tolerances prove this)
- Can reuse existing issue management UI for reporting violations
- Differentiates from pure geometry clash tools like Navisworks

**Key references**:
- https://github.com/opensourceBIM/IfcValidator
- https://github.com/buildingSMART/IDS (IDS is essentially a rule format)

---

### 6. Speckle Integration (Load from Speckle)

**What**: Add a "Load from Speckle" option that connects to a user's Speckle server (cloud or self-hosted) and pulls model geometry + properties directly into ClashControl. This positions ClashControl as the clash detection engine for the Speckle ecosystem, which currently lacks production-ready clash detection.

**Why**:
- Speckle connects to Revit, Rhino, ArchiCAD, SketchUp, and 20+ other tools — one integration gives ClashControl access to all of them
- Eliminates manual IFC export step entirely
- Speckle has no production clash detection — their demo repo is explicitly "not for production"
- `@speckle/objectloader` (JS, available on esm.sh) streams objects directly to the browser
- Speckle's viewer is Three.js-based (same as ClashControl) — geometry conversion patterns are well-documented
- Apache 2.0 license — fully compatible with ClashControl's SSPL
- Authentication via Personal Access Token (simple) or OAuth2 with PKCE (full)
- GraphQL API for browsing Projects → Models → Versions

**Implementation approach**:
- Load `@speckle/objectloader` from CDN (lazy, like web-ifc)
- Speckle mesh conversion: flat vertex array + face prefix format → Three.js BufferGeometry (Z-up → Y-up coordinate swap)
- Property mapping: Speckle schema → ClashControl element props (speckle_type → ifcType, parameters → psets, level → storey)
- New SpeckleImportPanel component (~150 lines): server URL, token input, project/model/version browser, load button
- ~420 lines total addition to index.html
- No downstream changes needed — both bridges produce the standard `{meshes, elements, storeys, ...}` shape

### 7. Local Clash Detection Engine (Multi-Threaded, Exact Intersection)

**What**: A Python service on `localhost:19800` that runs exact mesh-vs-mesh clash detection using all CPU cores. ClashControl sends model geometry + rules via HTTP, the local engine runs multi-threaded triangle intersection using Open3D/trimesh, and returns clash results. Falls back to the browser OBB engine when the server isn't running.

**Why**:
- Browser JS engine is single-threaded — 10K × 10K element models take 60s+ or OOM
- Approximate OBB intersection misses edge cases and can't compute exact penetration depth or intersection volume
- Local engine uses `ProcessPoolExecutor` across all CPU cores — 5-10x faster
- Exact mesh boolean operations give true intersection volume and penetration depth
- No architecture change to ClashControl — just an alternative code path for `detectClashesAsync()`
- Same clash result shape — the UI, 3D viewer, BCF export all work without changes
- CSP already allows `http://localhost:*` — no changes needed

**Implementation approach**:
- Python server with `http.server` + `websockets` for progress updates
- `trimesh` for mesh operations + BVH, `open3d` for boolean intersection
- Broad phase: vectorized sweep-and-prune with NumPy
- Narrow phase: parallel exact triangle-triangle intersection via `ProcessPoolExecutor`
- ClashControl checks `GET /status` on load to detect if engine is available
- See `LOCAL_ENGINE_GUIDE.md` for the complete build specification

**Key references**:
- https://github.com/mikedh/trimesh (2,800+ stars, mesh processing)
- https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D (11,000+ stars, 3D data processing)

### 8. ArchiCAD Direct Connector

**What**: A WebSocket connector for ArchiCAD using the same `localhost` pattern as the Revit Direct Connector. Streams model geometry + properties from ArchiCAD to ClashControl over `ws://localhost:19781`, and receives clash results back for highlighting.

**Why**:
- ArchiCAD is the second most popular BIM authoring tool globally
- ArchiCAD has a built-in [JSON API](https://archicadapi.graphisoft.com/) that is much easier to work with than Revit's .NET API — can potentially be done as a Python script rather than a compiled plugin
- Same WebSocket protocol as Revit connector — `model-start`, `element-batch`, `model-end`, `highlight`, `push-clashes`
- Same clash result flow — no changes to ClashControl's detection or UI
- Expands ClashControl's reach to ArchiCAD users who currently must export IFC

**Implementation approach**:
- Python or C++ add-on using ArchiCAD's JSON API / Add-On SDK
- WebSocket server on `localhost:19781`
- Geometry extraction via ArchiCAD's 3D model API (tessellated bodies)
- Property extraction via element properties API
- Coordinate conversion: ArchiCAD is millimeters, Z-up → meters, Y-up
- Same message protocol as Revit connector

## CONSIDER — High Value but Requires Architecture Changes

### 9. ThatOpen Fragments Migration

**What**: Replace the current IFC geometry caching with ThatOpen's Fragments binary format. Convert IFC to Fragments once, store, then load 10x faster on subsequent opens. GPU instancing for identical geometries.

**Why it is valuable**:
- 10x faster model loading (proven benchmark)
- Better memory management for large models
- GPU instancing reduces draw calls dramatically
- Worker-based architecture keeps UI responsive
- Already noted as a TODO in the ClashControl codebase

**Why it is hard**:
- Requires ESM bundling — breaks single-file architecture
- Requires Three.js version upgrade (r128 to r160+)
- Fragments API assumes module-based imports
- Would be the biggest architectural change in the project's history

**Recommendation**: Start with a proof-of-concept in a branch. If single-file constraint is ever relaxed, this becomes the #1 priority.

### 10. Point Cloud Overlay (Scan-to-BIM Clashes)

**What**: Load LAS/LAZ point cloud files alongside IFC models. Overlay laser scans on BIM models to detect as-built vs. as-designed discrepancies.

**Why it is valuable**:
- Scan-to-BIM is a growing market (renovation, retrofit, facility management)
- three-loader (Potree for Three.js) integrates with existing Three.js setup
- Visually powerful — point cloud + BIM model side by side
- Could detect clashes between point cloud and IFC geometry

**Why it is hard**:
- Point clouds are large (hundreds of MB to GB)
- Needs LOD streaming to be practical
- three-loader adds ~100KB+ dependency
- Clash detection between point cloud and mesh is computationally different from mesh-mesh

**Recommendation**: Start with visualization only (overlay point cloud on model), add clash detection later.

- https://github.com/pnext/three-loader (272 stars, Potree for Three.js)
- https://github.com/OpenAEC-Foundation/open-pointcloud-studio

---

### 11. Real-Time Multi-User Collaboration

**What**: Multiple users view the same model simultaneously. Shared cursors, shared viewpoints, real-time issue creation/updates via WebRTC or WebSocket.

**Why it is valuable**:
- BIM coordination meetings involve multiple people reviewing clashes together
- Currently everyone must be on one screen or export BCF and email around
- WebRTC is peer-to-peer — no server infrastructure needed
- Would be a unique feature among open-source BIM tools

**Why it is hard**:
- Needs signaling server (even for WebRTC)
- State synchronization is complex (who moves the camera? conflict resolution?)
- Model data is large — can't easily share full geometry over WebRTC
- Significant UX design work (presence indicators, permissions, etc.)

**Recommendation**: Start with "shared viewpoint" — one user shares a link, others see the same camera position and issues. Full real-time collaboration is a separate project.

## DO NOT IMPLEMENT — Poor Fit or Low ROI

### Switching to xeokit Rendering Engine
- **Why not**: Would require rewriting the entire 3D viewer from scratch. xeokit is AGPL-licensed (copyleft), which may conflict with ClashControl's licensing. The existing Three.js setup works well and has a much larger ecosystem. Effort-to-benefit ratio is terrible.
- https://github.com/xeokit/xeokit-sdk (888 stars, AGPL)

### Switching to ifc-lite as Parser
- **Why not**: Very new project (January 2026), API is still changing rapidly. WebGPU browser support is still not universal. Would introduce Rust/WASM build complexity. Worth watching but too early to adopt. ClashControl's web-ifc integration is mature and working.
- https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite (143 stars, very new)

### Full BIM Server / CDE Backend
- **Why not**: ClashControl is a client-side tool by design. Adding a server component (like BIMserver or BIMROCKET) fundamentally changes the product. The BCF-API integration (item 3 above) gives server connectivity without running a server.
- https://github.com/opensourceBIM/BIMserver (1,703 stars but Java backend)

### IFC Authoring / Model Editing
- **Why not**: ClashControl detects problems, it doesn't create models. Adding IFC authoring (like Bonsai/BlenderBIM or ThatOpen's engine_clay) would massively expand scope without clear user value. Users create models in Revit/ArchiCAD/FreeCAD and bring them to ClashControl for checking.
- https://github.com/ThatOpen/engine_clay

### Full Quantity Takeoff / Cost Estimation
- **Why not**: Moves away from core clash detection focus. Dedicated QTO tools (Bonsai BIM, commercial estimating software) do this much better. However, showing basic quantities for clashing elements (area, volume, count) is a reasonable small addition.

### Carbon/LCA Calculation
- **Why not**: Requires maintaining a carbon factor database that needs constant updating by region/material. Regulatory requirements vary by country. Better served by dedicated tools. However, linking to external carbon databases (like OpenAEC's warmteverliesberekening approach) could be a lightweight integration later.

### IFC5 Support
- **Why not now**: The standard is still in active development and not finalized. No production IFC5 files exist yet. web-ifc doesn't support it. Revisit when the standard stabilizes (likely 2027+).
- https://github.com/buildingSMART/IFC5-development (178 stars, still in development)

### Multi-Agent AI Orchestration
- **Why not**: ClashControl's existing NL chat and AI integration already work well for single-user workflows. OpenAEC's Open-Agents pattern is designed for development automation, not end-user BIM tools. The complexity overhead doesn't match the single-file architecture.
