# ClashControl Rendering & Performance Notes

## Context

Analysis of GPU instancing feasibility (prompted by comparison with Fragments .frag format), covering what the codebase already does well, confirmed efficiency gaps, and what to leave alone.

## Corrections to Initial Assumptions

| Claim | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Clash detection is OBB-based" | It is **AABB BVH + Möller-Trumbore triangle-triangle** (`index.html:2588–2666`). More precise than OBB. |
| "Ghost system swaps material with no caching" | True it swaps, but **`_ghostMatCache` (UUID-keyed, `index.html:4725`) caches clones** — ghost materials are not recreated per frame. |
| "`mesh.applyMatrix4()` bakes transform into geometry — critical bug" | **False.** `THREE.Mesh.applyMatrix4` calls `Object3D.applyMatrix4` which only updates the mesh's own matrix. Geometry vertices are not mutated. `geoCache` sharing is safe. |

## What Already Works Well (Leave Alone)

### IFC path — geometry & material deduplication
- `geoCache` (`index.html:1884`) shares one `THREE.BufferGeometry` across all placed elements with the same `geometryExpressID`. Because Three.js shares the same object reference, WebGL uploads the vertex buffer to the GPU **once** — VRAM deduplication is already in place.
- `matCache` (`index.html:1884`) shares one `THREE.MeshPhongMaterial` per unique RGBA color.
- The only remaining cost is **one draw call per mesh**, not one geometry upload per mesh.

### Transform baking
- `_ccBakeMesh` (`index.html:1302–1307`) freezes `matrixAutoUpdate = false` and `frustumCulled = false` on every mesh at load time. Per-frame transform cost is zero.

### Manual frustum culling + LOD proxies
- `updateCulling` (`index.html:5833`) does a frustum check per mesh per frame and substitutes a shared box proxy (`_lodBoxGeo` / `_lodProxyMat`, shared objects) for distant elements. Avoids GPU overdraw on large models.

### Clash detection engine
- AABB BVH (`index.html:2588–2615`) for broad-phase; Möller-Trumbore triangle-triangle for narrow-phase. Three-tier cache (`_wvCache`, `_triCache`, `_bvhCache`) avoids re-extracting world geometry per candidate pair within a single run.
- **Do not touch the algorithm.** Geometrically correct and already cache-efficient within a run.

### Worker-based IFC loading
- Geometry extraction runs off the main thread. Do not change the worker boundary.

### Ghost material cache
- `_ghostMatCache` (`index.html:4725`) keyed by `origMat.uuid` — one ghost clone per unique material, reused across all elements sharing that material.

## Confirmed Efficiency Gaps

### 1. GLB path: no matCache — LOW effort
**Gap:** `loadGLB` (`index.html:7766`) creates `new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial` per node. No deduplication.
**Fix:** Add `matCache["r,g,b,a"]` identical to the IFC path.
**Risk:** None.

### 2. GLB path: geometry cloned per node, normals recomputed per clone — LOW effort
**Gap:** `child.geometry.clone()` (`index.html:7777`) is called for every GLTF node even when nodes share the same mesh. `computeVertexNormals()` (`index.html:7778`) is then called on every clone.
**Fix:** Track seen `child.geometry.uuid`; skip the clone for duplicates and reuse the existing `THREE.BufferGeometry`. `computeVertexNormals` then runs once per unique geometry.
**Risk:** Low. Geometries are read-only at this stage.

### 3. GLB worker: shared GLTF mesh primitives re-extracted per node — MEDIUM effort
**Gap:** The worker (`index.html:2969–2992`) re-reads primitive vertex data each time a node references the same `node.mesh` index. For a building with 500 identical columns, primitive data is parsed 500 times.
**Fix:** Cache extracted local-space vertices/triangles by `node.mesh` index. Apply each node's world transform to the cached data.
**Risk:** Low, self-contained in the worker.

### 4. BVH caches not persistent across detection runs — MEDIUM effort
**Gap:** `_wvCache`, `_triCache`, `_bvhCache` are deleted after each 80-candidate chunk (`index.html:3603–3627`). Re-running detection rebuilds all BVHs from scratch.
**Fix:** Keep caches on elements between runs; invalidate on `LOAD_MODEL`/`REMOVE_MODEL` via a generation counter.
**Risk:** Medium — needs reliable invalidation to avoid stale cache after model changes.

### 5. GPU instancing via `THREE.InstancedMesh` — HIGH effort
**Gap:** Each IFC placement produces its own `THREE.Mesh` = one draw call. Geometry and material are already shared — collapsing them into one draw call is the remaining step.

**Subsystems requiring changes:**

| Subsystem | Change | Location |
|---|---|---|
| IFC loader | Post-streaming pass: group by `(geoExpId, matKey)`, create `InstancedMesh` for groups ≥ threshold | `index.html:1885–2001` |
| Element map | Add `expressId → { instancedMesh, instanceIndex }` lookup | loader output |
| Ghost system | `instanceColor` tinting or split-out per instance | `index.html:4725` |
| Hover system | `instanceColor.setXYZ(i,…)` instead of `material.emissive.set(…)` | `index.html:5260` |
| Raycasting | Map returned `instanceId` → `expressId` | `index.html:5410` |
| updateCulling | Per-instance visibility via count/instanceColor | `index.html:5833` |
| Clash detection | `getMatrixAt(i, m)` + apply to base geometry for `_wvCache`/`_triCache` | `index.html:2468` |

**Constraint:** Three.js r128 supports `THREE.InstancedMesh` natively. `EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing` GLB extension requires r135+ — GLB path cannot use GLTF-embedded instancing without a loader upgrade.
**Order:** IFC path first. GLB path requires gap #2 (geometry dedup) to be solved first.

## What to Leave Alone

| Area | Reason |
|---|---|
| htm parser | Hand-written, tested, fragile |
| IFC loader / web-ifc WASM integration | Working, complex |
| AABB BVH + Möller-Trumbore clash engine | Geometrically correct; do not change the algorithm |
| `_ccBakeMesh` | Correctly freezes transforms; instancing must be inserted before this is called |
| `invalidate()` render-on-demand system | Breaking causes GPU waste or no rendering |
| View cube quaternion inversion | Documented quirk; switching breaks mirroring |
| Three.js r128 version | Do not assume r135+ features |
| Per-model geoCache scope | Cross-model dedup requires content-hashing; not worth the complexity |

## Priority Summary

| # | Improvement | Effort | Gain | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | GLB matCache | Low | Material memory reduction | None |
| 2 | GLB geometry dedup + normals once | Low | Memory + CPU at load | Low |
| 3 | GLB worker mesh dedup | Medium | CPU at clash-prep for large GLBs | Low |
| 4 | Persistent BVH cache across runs | Medium | CPU at repeat detection | Medium |
| 5 | GPU instancing (IFC path first) | High | Draw calls for large repetitive buildings | Medium |
